1,INFJ,observer,"Should I go for a 64gb or 256gb iPad Air 2019? Will be using it for school, drawing, and gaming. I have an iCloud storage plan but will probably be downloading a lot of apps. I also want it to last me 3-4 years."
2,INFJ,observer,"I mean, there's nothing you can do. Apps nowadays don't support that iPad model or the version of iOS it is running most likely"
3,INFJ,observer,I have also never understood this.
4,INFJ,observer,"Unless your iPad has become unbearably slow or you are looking for apple pencil support, I don‚Äôt see any reason to upgrade."
5,INFJ,observer,Yeah I have the iPad Air and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it if you‚Äôre concerned about longevity. The screen is much nicer too because it‚Äôs laminated (I‚Äôm assuming since the iPad 7 didn‚Äôt say anything about a laminated screen it doesn‚Äôt have one.)
6,INFJ,observer,I got the new iPad Air for school and I love it. You don't really need the Pro unless you are looking to use it as a laptop replacement.
7,INFJ,observer,"I think it is the oldest ipad to be supported by ipad os? you can find this info on apples website. so it should be fine this year, but maybe next year it will become obsolete."
8,INFJ,observer,Seeing as how the 7th gen iPad still has the same old A10 chip as the 2018 iPad I'd say the 6th gen. Unless you care about a bigger screen/ smart keyboard.
9,INFJ,observer,I don't mind how it feels to write on the screen at all. You get used to it pretty quick
10,INFJ,observer,Rest in peace. What a beautiful kitty

20,INFP,decider,"Honestly, I think that an animated series, like confinement, would be a lot better. Some SCPs would look really weird with CGI expect if they spent a lot of money on it, but that's not too likely"
21,INFP,decider,Does it count if I put water into my shoe? Or if my feet are sweaty?
22,INFP,decider,"Way to go :) that can be a difficult but helpful step in removing mental clutter.

Personally, I like to come home and put my phone down in its spot and not pick it up until I leave the house again or unless I get a phone call. I consider social media to be part of my ""socializing"" time during the day and home time to be my ""personal"" time where I can focus on hobbies like painting, exercising, reading or writing. "
23,INFP,decider,"Haha! I love that :) 
yet it's the volcanoes that also make new land"
24,INFP,decider,"This reminds me of the stoic argument to stop reading new books: https://highexistence.com/stop-reading-new-books-seriously/

TLDR: The time we spend thinking about improving can be better spent on actively improving. 

Personally, I think reflection can help us focus our energies and be more productive as long as we actually follow through on our plans."
25,INFP,decider,"Well said. 

When we say something that is in danger of hurting another person's pride, they are generally more likely to get defensive and become less receptive to what we have to say. 

It is much more productive to find a kind way to say what we want them to know that motivates the person to do better, rather than tears them down and risks them furthering negative thought cycles.


As Stoics, I see it as our goal to release our own pride so that we might better understand the truth in what a person says rather than be harmed by the distasteful or unrefined nature in which they communicate."
26,INFP,decider,"I think it's so awesome that you were motivated to meditate entirely from your own experience of consciousness and learned the practices by yourself.

I'm not sure if this is the same, but I often call that scary feeling that emerges ""Holy shit moments"". I think I might have been about the same age as you when I first felt mine, although they first emerged for me from the contemplations of infinite time and present-ness. 

I remember asking a family friend about this feeling and she told me that it was my physical body realizing its own mortality. I'm not sure if that is what it is... although there definitely is a feeling of vulnerability in it. 

It's been a regular practice for me to make as much of my waking and now dreaming life have that ""holy shit"" feel to it. Meditation has helped me achieve that and even increase its strength. It's no longer scary. It makes my senses feel enhanced and time seems to pass differently, although I haven't really noticed something trying to communicate with me as you have. I will try to pay more attention, thanks :)"
27,INFP,decider,"What helps for me is remembering that their beliefs give them great joy and that I do not wish to take that away from them.

 Sometimes I replace the words they use with ones that match my own beliefs (such as 'God' with 'Nature' or 'the unknown'). Looking to the intention of what is being said. If it is compassionate, accepting it with gratitude. If it is not, then releasing it and not letting it take hold. If they choose to get angry and upset with me, then I wish them well and hope their karma does not bring them much suffering. "
28,INFP,decider,"For a modern take, I'm currently reading ""the subtle art of not giving a fuck"" by Mark Manson. It's entertaining and offers a practical definition of happiness that I think merits the attention it received. "
29,INFP,decider,This is seriously my favorite show :)
30,INFP,decider,Yes :) me too! It's been a great tool for my practice
31,INFP,decider,"Look to your mind as if it were a small child. Hold it in your mind's arms and rock it gently.

32,INFP,decider,"Keep in mind that the third eye might not open until all the chakras before it are cleared and in balance.

55,INTJ,observer,"MtG!!! Do you play EDH? I love MtG. Also, the grabbing of the wrist gesture is definitely worthy of self defense. If anyone grabs you by the wrist you are in danger. I would have, after that, kept pepper spray or bear mace on me at all times. Whenever I see someone sketchy hanging out in a parking lot I don't even get out of my car I just drive to the next store. Scary stuff."
56,INTJ,observer,"Delete or make your social media as private as you can. My life's been a lot better since deleting Facebook and my insta is private. Don't accept anyone you don't know and tbh, if he's making fake accounts on ig, report them all for abuse/harassment. You shouldn't have to live your life afraid of some creep. It scares me that he's so bold with you. It means if he wanted to, he could enact violence against you. Please try and get a restraining order against him when you can. Get authorities involved. I don't want this to end badly and I'm genuinely concerned for you. I would also recommend carrying mace or bear mace with you home from school so that if he assaults you, you have some form of self defence."
57,INTJ,observer,"Big yikes. I really hope he lost his job. That is not okay at all to do, especially in a position of a teacher or authority. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. This is why, as a woman, I tend to trust females over males in authority positions. I hate that it has to be like that but I've had past trauma related to the same and it's unfortunate for good and professional males in those positions."
58,INTJ,observer,"How can they be so cruel?! A dog pee pad?! For a baby????? Unbelievable. I hope she gets justice, I feel so bad for her and her little boy."
59,INTJ,observer,"Have you ever looked at local comic book shops? They usually or sometimes have Friday night magic. It's a cool experience and lots of casual or even serious play depending on what you're looking for. It's a lot of fun. 

I mean, assault on a younger male is still to be expected. John Gacey only attacked males. I'd still watch yourself and maybe take some classes on self defense. A creepy old guy ran at my mother and I when we left a Wendy's asking for change and she told me never talk to people that beg like that. It's from growing up in south Chicago. She took a brick to the eye at a gas station once. I wouldn't put anything passed people."

69,INTJ,observer,"Normally fluids can be used as an indicator of which way is down. If you tilt a glass of water, the water doesn‚Äôt tilt with the glass. However, here, the pilot did a very particular manoeuvre so that there was a centrifugal force that appeared around the same as gravity on the liquid. 

Centrifugal force is an inertial force (it‚Äôs not an actual force, but it seems like it is). 

When in a car at a constant speed, you won‚Äôt be experienced any force. You are neither accelerating or decelerating in any particular direction. If you go round a corner, however, you will feel a force pushing you opposite to the direction of the turn. This is because your body would, if unimpeded, continue in a straight line. But since you are constrained by the car, you feel a force as if you are being pulled against the turn, while the car counterbalances this. 

The same is happening to the liquid. If the plane disappeared mid turn, leaving just the fluid, it carries on in a straight line. However, the plane is still there, along with the glass. And the pilot has set up his manoeuvre so that the apparent force that the fluid experiences is close to what you experience from gravity. It looks like the liquid isn‚Äôt being affected by the turn."
70,INTJ,observer,"You see, I‚Äôm still amazed that people haven‚Äôt worked out that publishing video evidence of yourself committing a major crime is really not a good idea."
71,INTJ,observer,"Oh yeah. He didn‚Äôt quite do that, he took all the normal classes, and more arts/humanities focused classes ‚Äî which at out HS were relatively easy. We both did well on standardised tests and got into our first choice colleges."

As a black, I myself am more offended at the fact dumbfucks like the show runner want to change a character just because they think I'll find it more appealing. Imagine if Black Panther was white, it's exactly like that. But just because it's white to black it isn't a big deal? GTFO"

The Old MC was a goat in personality, confident and witty is used a lot in characters because it simply works. The shy awkward dork character trope is far less used because if done wrong it makes the MC bland and boring and frustrating, all of which describes the new MC.

You knew it would upset them, you knew what they were asking of you, but you selfishly did it anyway.  If you can't own up to that you're being dishonest with yourself and the people around you.

On the topic of impact, I wholly disagree that it doesn't affect your family.  The top comments responding otherwise sound like inexperienced young people who can't think beyond their personal gain.  The likelihood of you having it work out for the long run with this girl is just not there considering the amount of thought you put into hopping in bed with her.  The risk you took will create a lot of unnecessary awkwardness to groups of people all for the sake of getting your willy wet when there are so many other options to choose from outside of this family.  It's not unheard of for such relations to happen but often the success comes from the lovers taking precautions in regards to the people who may be negatively impacted by the union crumbling.  You could've kept it all discreet between the two of you and not have anyone ever find out in case it goes sour, while coming out to the family if it grew to something serious.  True, she is the one to spill the beans, now the both of you look like idiots.  Your inability to take adequate steps to avoid this unnecessary mess (not even saying you can't have your cake here) shows how little you understand when it comes to the implications of your actions.

Moving forward I hope you think harder about the way you handle your relationship with this girl, and not just rampage through life on the belief that collateral damage doesn't exist or does not matter.

Edit: really did not expect this to blow up as much as it did, thanks for the gold and rip inbox."
153,INTJ,observer,"YTA even after your comments.  What you presented was misleading.  You lived together and he went on vacation for two weeks.  He didn't ghost you while dating until your patience wore out after 2 weeks of limbo.  You knew you were going to have the chance to confront him when he came home.  He was an ass to not contact you during that time but instead of withholding judgement at least until you saw him again you maliciously fucked another man.  Don't try to pretend you didn't know, you knew what you were doing.  You wanted to teach him a lesson.  You didn't truly believe you were broken up because you expected reconciliation after your actions, like he'd throw up his hands and say we need to work hard on this relationship I understand why you'd cheat on me.  You wouldn't have continued living with him if you really believed you were no longer together.

I would've said ESH if your escalation of the situation wasn't so completely out of this world when weighed against his actions.  I could've even said NTA if your expectations didn't completely contradict your actions.

EDIT:

>I did not care. i just wanted him to message me once in a while.

Revenge sex confirmed...and you expected your relationship to work out after that stunt.  Would've been one thing if you were breaking up with him but to use your vagina as a nuclear tool of punishment?  Yeah, you're definitely the asshole here."
154,INTJ,observer,">OP's husband likely sexually assaulted their daughter.

That is actually quite outlandish to the degree of suspecting a dad to be a kidnapper for being out alone with his child.

People want to believe that kids are always innocent and that is just not true.  All it takes is a trauma as simple as a divorce for kids to turn into little shits.  They don't need to be sexually abused to act out this way.  I once dated a guy who was a shithead to his family for exactly this reason, which is no wonder why I left him.  By his own admission he couldn't cope with his parent's divorce and lack of security from moving so often.  Everything else about his upbringing from his parents was normal while he was almost kicked out of school due to his rebellion.  This included the years of therapy he was put through.  My own brother holds extreme resentment against our father because he wasn't the dad my brother wished for, nevermind that the man he talks ill of holds a master's but took on a paper boy route to put food on the table.  He would never raise his voice, or strike us the way our mom did.  We were both raised the same way and yet I was recently contacted by my brother's frustrated friend asking me how I came out of our upbringing well adjusted while my brother treats everyone around him like shit.

OP's husband is a military dad that was not very present in his daughter's life due to his job.  I can believe that is enough to set off the chain reaction of behaviors coming from OP's daughter, especially when she refuses therapy."
155,INTJ,observer,"Seriously, I can't get through a thread in this sub without seeing people looking to insert their wild imagined narratives into op's story.

158,INTJ,observer,"Having unresolved issues to deal with does not absolve a person from the shitty actions they inflict on others, much like how having a mental diagnosis does not make someone NTA for emotionally abusing their family and friends.  We can say that bystanders are good people for being understanding and sticking it out, but the daughter is still the asshole in this situation despite any generosity from others."
159,INTJ,observer,"Everything you said would make sense if the relationship was between two reasonable people, to which OP's wife is not.  Instead of making any effort to understand the effect of her actions she throws a tantrum and calls him an asshole.  A reasonable person would say ""I understand I inadvertently hurt you, but I would still like to have my holiday, is there anything else I can do to make this up to you?""  Then saying ""it's okay, we'll just continue on as if nothing happened"" would be an acceptable answer to that.

A tit for tat response is a response to a person who refuses to do the minimum effort of acknowledging, let alone take ownership of their actions.  Tit for tat is not even the correct term for this.  It's holding a person accountable for their decisions.  You'd think OP's wife would understand the importance of following through with their word (especially as an example for her own kids), but thus far she's completely failed in demonstrating this understanding, or any understanding of where she went wrong.  Instead she chooses to dig her heels in, that's hugely concerning.  How is she going to do better in the future if she refuses to see where she is wrong today?  If OP were to ignore this pivotal problem in order to take the high road all he is doing is opening doors to entice his wife into an abusive relationship in which he enables her behavior, reaffirming that consequences do not apply to her."
160,INTJ,observer,"It's because the mother is the one who is being unreasonable, but the son is the one who is expected to apologize while she acts like a baby.  This short is very realistic to Asian culture and the way the hierarchical aspect can get out of hand. The mom looks at her son like he's her doll, not a person with his own wants and needs.  Even as he reaches adulthood he never grows in height so the mom continues to tower over him.  She feels entitled to his privacy, treats it like he's keeping secrets from her.  Then makes food for his sake without asking if he has plans.  The expectation is that she comes before his friends by default.  At the end of the short, the absentee dad's only contribution is to push his kid to go confront his mom to solve the fight.

While it's nice the mom comes to see the error of her ways on her own, the child is the one who comforts their parent.  In abusive households you may as well be telling the victims the abuser is the one who deserves empathy.   A child should not be subjected to becoming the mature adult for their own parents.  

I could never show my mom this film because the only takeaway she'd glean from this is that children should show absolute respect and obedience to their parent's whims well past adulthood and that even Pixar agrees with her."

162,INTJ,observer,"NTA.  In my last long term relationship I dated a guy who treated me like I was his servant.  He'd leave his wrappers all over the place, soda cans, used dishes.  I'd clean the place top to bottom, leave to go visit family for a weekend only to come home and find a pig sty left for me to clean.

So my birthday rolls around and he asked me what I wanted for my day.  I told him I just wanted a whole day where I didn't have to do any of the chores.  By dinner time he had a mental breakdown and asked me to cook.  There was a particular cognitive dissonance with him insisting that what I do is easy even after that day, as if his incapability to do what I do just vanished from his mind, but when I confronted him about it by holding his feet to the fire he'd turn into a petulant child calling me cruel and heartless.

Obviously I left his ass long ago.  Today I'm still the one that prefers my home at a certain level of cleanliness so I'm the one doing most of the chores.  The difference is that my husband will readily help me and pick up the slack when I'm feeling tired.  My saying is always that I do x,y,z because I love my partner, not because it's my job."

167,ISTJ,observer,"In my house, it's ""You'll never make it in college or in life"" for as long as I can remember and ""I wish I didn't have kids"" (I am the oldest of 2). I have been in college for 3 years and still stuck in prereqs (I'm currently an engineering major), I have struggled in most of my classes and unfortunately failed a few, and I have had to drop one. 

I keep getting compared to all of my friends from high school. Of the group, I am the only engineering major, but I believe all of us except maybe one is in STEM, so it's also a matter of ""Well, they can pass their classes, why can't you?"" ""Oh, they're working and you're not and you're still unable to pass? Well, then you really must be stupid."" And the worst, ""EVERYONE is doing better than you."" I didn't get accepted to the university most of them went to, so while they did have each other, I moved away 4 hours from home and had to do almost everything on my own, and it was scary at first, but I am thankful for the people I met.

The classes I haven't passed have lowered my confidence considerably, and while I do enjoy what I'm learning, I struggle a lot in exams, and it doesn't help that most prereqs are set as weed-outs making tests the majority of the weight of our grades, and worse when there's 2-3 exams during the semester. I'm on probation and may be forced to change majors, and it's put a serious dent in me. I am at the moment looking for other options and trying to speak to people to see what I could do that could help me lead to engineering in the future if it's not the path for me right now.

This semester I failed one of my classes and when I finally got the courage to tell my dad, he yelled at me and told me it was my fault and that I was stupid, + the other usual insults of how I'm useless and won't get anywhere in life (I didn't know what I made on an exam that was 25% of my grade until after grades posted. I did inform the dean and the assistant and someone else in that department are in touch with me).

I don't even remember if it was for the test or some other crap (I write all of my test dates on the family calendar in the kitchen, everyone in the house passes it and reads it at least once in a day so no one can claim they didn't see it on there), and I went to school feeling miserable af. My friends and my Cal BC teacher were concerned and I think I eventually told them what happened but yeah. One of my worst mornings growing up.

I legit can't think of a single time that my dad has apologized for anything, regardless of who the recipient should have been. What's worse is my brother (16), is picking up on this, and me and my mom are working on trying to get him to understand that accepting responsibility for your actions and apologizing when needed is important and it's not something you can ignore. I can't do much now since I go to school 4 hours from home (I do come back for breaks).

I unfortunately got hit with bad luck for the environment part and couldn't get much taller, and neither of my paternal grandparents were 5' tall, so I managed to edge them out a smidge.

173,ISTJ,observer,">But his stubborn ass wants to take the advanced classes because he doesn't want to be with the stupid kids.

This mentality of being stuck with stupid kids really needs to be discussed and this thought process needs to go down the drain. I've seen this in several posts this week and I'm not understanding why a person not taking ap classes = stupid. Some of these kids may have looked into the requirements, knew they couldn't handle the workload and decided not to do it, especially if they are working or struggling in regular level or honors classes (my school district was AP/Honors/regular level in terms of difficulty) If you think about it, that's pretty smart. 
As someone else said, your brother's only doing it to say they're in an AP class and not want to do the work. Also, I agree with everyone who said your parents should let your brother suffer the consequences of not doing the summer homework. Had this been my own brother, I would have said no to helping him (I don't care how much he would have cussed me out for it), and honestly, I don't think either of my parents would have been willing to help. (My APs are a bit more chill and don't want us taking every AP class offered. My cap was 3 + one DC, and the same requirements for my brother, as he is expected to help around the house as well, but if we can't manage our time, that's our problem, not theirs (note: I'm 21(f) and bro's 16))"

For some reason, male hygiene is so low on the list in society. Yeah, my husband is dense, but I feel like it still should have been taught to him. Totally agree!! I hope male skincare becomes normalized!"

3: I made sex a priority. I‚Äôm the ‚Äúlow desire partner‚Äù and only want sex once a week/once a month if left to my own devices.

What FINALLY worked for me: all of your products are amazing, but if you want to improve longevity, consider adding an oil to your routine. Dry skin lacks oil, which causes moisture from your products to evaporate through the day potentially. Patting in 2-4 drops of oil on top of your products as a last step could get rid of any remaining tightness or flakes you might be experiencing. I use Physician‚Äôs Formula Bright Booster oil. It‚Äôs organic, has AMAZING oils in it, it won‚Äôt clog pores, and it‚Äôs saved my skin. It completely absorbs into your skin after 30 min to an hour. It also makes my makeup go on beautifully."

My husband and I have similar backgrounds to you and your wife, but we have sex 1-3 times a week even if we don‚Äôt have penetration. 

Your wife seems to have more issues than just vaginismus. I think you guys might benefit from a sex therapist. If she has no sex drive, there‚Äôs gotta be something you guys can do, a way she can enjoy sex. Has she orgasmed before?

Marriages can‚Äôt survive with zero intimacy. She should be taking your needs into consideration if you‚Äôre taking hers into consideration."

191,ENFJ,decider,"Hey, for what it‚Äôs worth, your reaction is totally and completely valid no matter what. I had no sexual trauma‚ÄîI was just terrified of my vagina (and my butthole...and my belly button... lol). When my high school bf tried to grab me down there THROUGH JEANS I about had a panic attack and cried whenever I thought about it. 

I flinched when people went near my vagina‚Äîdoctors, my fiance (now husband). I wanted sex but I was TERRIFIED of down there. It was scary and disgusted me and I hated it. I couldn‚Äôt even FIND my vagina. 

It turned out I needed a hymenectomy, then I had to spend some time just looking at my vagina to desensitize myself because I thought they were so ugly. I tried to ‚Äúexplore‚Äù but it was so disgusting to me to touch the area (even tho I would masturbate through clothes). I‚Äôd feel intense panic and struggle not to cry. I was married and I couldn‚Äôt touch my own vagina lol.

Dilating helped me take control of my vagina and that part of my life. At first, I was so so so scared. But I wanted to be better. If dilators (Or in this case tampons) scare you, then take tiny baby steps. Your first ‚Äúdilating‚Äù session could be pressing the dilator against your inner thigh. Then your vulva. Then near your entrance. Then in it. You could stretch this over weeks, never going further unless you felt you could. If you feel the anxiety, stop. Just keep it right where it is. Get used to it, till something on your inner thigh isn‚Äôt a big deal, till it‚Äôs not a big deal against your vulva, till it‚Äôs not a big deal near your entrance, till it‚Äôs not a big deal to penetrate.

Once I could consistently get a dilator in, some of my panic subsided. And once I was able to go up in sizes consistently, my anxiety evaporated. I knew this part of my body. I understood it. I knew exactly where it was, how to get inside it, and how everything would feel. I could do it in different positions. I could do it whenever I felt like it. I had regained control over my body.

I have no experience with sexual trauma but I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt sell yourself short and trust your feelings, period, because it‚Äôs not exactly a typical thing to imagine it‚Äôs happened to you and to be wrong. And I say take your time and go so slow. If you want to do this, you CAN do this. It might help to visit with a therapist. But I hope my experience might help a little, even if it‚Äôs not quite the same."
192,ENFJ,decider,"No! Definitely not! Your pelvic floor muscles *have* to tighten in order to orgasm! It‚Äôs a good thing‚Äîthe one positive experience you might have with your vagina that day. Keep it up!

193,ENFJ,decider,"I was like this, and I ended up having vaginismus but that doesn‚Äôt mean you will. I was like ‚ÄúNope. It‚Äôs just wrong. Things don‚Äôt go in there.‚Äù This made putting in a tampon go horrifically wrong‚Äîsweating, crying, panicked because I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfind the hole.‚Äù

I ignored it for years. High school boyfriend tried to go down on me but I felt too panicked and started crying for no apparent reason. It turns out I had a hymen problem (which is why I couldn‚Äôt find the hole, and I had to get surgery) but that‚Äôs not what caused my weird phobia of penetration. My phobia seems to have caused my vaginismus, so when I finally got to penetration after my surgery, it hurt pretty bad. Hopefully that‚Äôs not the case for you. 

What helped me get past it (as I now can have sex): I spent time just looking at my vagina with a mirror. It stopped grossing me out after doing this a lot; it‚Äôs just a vagina. Neutral. Then I laid my hand on my bare vagina/vulva/whatever which I always avoided doing‚Äîand it felt *so wrong* but I kept it there for 60 second intervals. Soon it felt clinical, not a big deal. Then I dilated for the first time when I got my kit, and that was a huge deal. It was so hard the first few times (like, what if I can‚Äôt find the hole? What if it doesn‚Äôt go in?) but after 5-10 times, it felt normal, natural. Soon it was normal and I felt like I had control of the situation, and I was able to get through dilators and have sex. I‚Äôm not 100% there with my vagina‚ÄîI don‚Äôt like fingering myself for instance‚Äîbut I‚Äòm totally fine with a penis and tampons and that‚Äôs all I want lol."

195,ENFJ,decider,"I‚Äôd be extremely upset. This whole thing gets me fired up. I‚Äôm cured now, and I just think guys who whine about their partners having vaginismus are being so narrow minded and selfish. How would they feel if sex felt like their skin was being ripped off their penis each and every thrust? How would they feel if sex, even without vaginismus, felt pretty mediocre? Vaginas have the same amount of nerve endings as the back of your hand. So imagine rubbing the back of your hand really fast and that‚Äôs what penetration feels like. Wow, AMAZING... 

Guys get this mindblowing incredible experience with penetration, but 30% of women experience pain during sex. And yet men feel entitled when this isn‚Äôt handed to them on a silver platter?

You‚Äôre a woman who loves him. You‚Äôre so so so much more than your capacity to have ONE type of sex. Don‚Äôt let him forget that. And don‚Äôt let vaginismus keep you guys from exploring and getting creative. We still do stuff we discovered because penetration wasn‚Äôt an option, and it‚Äôs been amazing even now that we can do penetration."

I feel as though it is extremely relevant to link that post from the other day that talked about skincare as an actual obsession.

In my opinion, when it comes to financial matters you have to keep to a practical approach. That debt can't just vanish, it has to go somewhere since it's a tangible thing in the physical world... Or as close to real as perceived debt can be. Maybe you could tweak the probability of some computer snafu deleting your account, the government taking action, or a relative decides to give you a load of money, but it's all so very unlikely. Gordon White and Jason Miller have great books on financial magick (Gordon's is The Chaos Protocols. I think Miller's is called Financial Sorcery).

281,ISFJ,observer,"Firstly, those are not dicothomies. There are 8 cognitive functions.

Each type (codes) have its unique cognitive stack.

You just need to know the two functions you use the most. The one you use the most is your dominant, the second one is the supporter or auxiliary.

**COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS**

**Perceiving**

Extroverted Sensing (Se for short) - Focusing on the moment and concrete reality, physical and engaged with senses (not 5, sorry. There are more than 100 senses)

Introverted Sensing (Si) - Comparing present with past, using tried and true or traditional methods, internal senses (hunger, thirst, pain)

Extroverted Intuition (Ne) - Pursuing possibilities that may or may not act on, new ideas and concepts, drawn to theory, innovative and creative/original, idea/theory in breadith

Introverted Intuition (Ni) - Focusing on the meaning, trusting the unconscious information, conclusions come out of nowhere, idea/theory in depth

**Judging**

Extroverted Thinking (Te) - Organizing the outer world, thinking out loud, directing people, efficiency of the systems

Introverted Thinking (Ti) - Thinking inwardly, taking apart systems to analyze in depth, logical decisions

Extroverted Feeling (Fe) - Seeking outer harmony, dislikes conflict, evaluating others' feelings

Introverted Feeling (Fi) - Doing what you want for personal happiness, controlling and engaging with inner emotions

Now find the description you fit the most. This is your dominant function. Then here are some rules to choose your secondary function:

1- The identity (Introverted/Extroverted) must be reversed on the secondary function.

2- The role (Perceiving/Judging) must be different on the secondary function.

This creates 16 types and their most prefered function pairs. The first one is the dominant, the second one is the secondary/supporter/auxiliary.

**TYPES AND ITS FUNCTIONS**

INTJ - Intellectual - Ni Te (Dominant Introverted Intuition, Secondary Extroverted Thinking)

INTP - Inventor - Ti Ne

ENTJ - Leader - Te Ni

ENTP - Originator - Ne Ti

INFJ - Psychic - Ni Fe

INFP - Creative - Fi Ne

ENFJ - Inspirer - Fe Ni

ENFP - Charismatic - Ne Fi

ISTJ - Worker - Si Te

ISTP - Crafter - Ti Se

ESTJ - Boss - Te Si

ESTP - Daredevil - Se Ti

ISFJ - Helper - Si Fe

ISFP - Composer - Fi Se

ESFJ - Counseller - Fe Si

ESFP - Party Animal! - Se Fi

His lack of ambition and total denial of and unwillingness to engage with conflict and the fact that I wasn't happy led me to literally being on the brink of leaving him. We were fighting every day, desperately unhappy.  

When he thought I was leaving him, he cried the first tears I'd ever seen from him-- in over a decade. It was a real wake up call for him. He began to consider his own actions and how terribly uninvolved he had been in my life. 

We've worked hard on our relationship and have gotten things to a better place, but we have kids and so lots of reasons to stay together. If your relationship is worth saving I'd try to see a counselor together to have a safe place to express your needs. If he can't change and acknowledge your needs, you absolutely deserve more than what you've got right now."

However, after reading your answer to whenever you daydream or attached to reality. It literally screams Ni to me. So therefore, my answer will be you are an INTJ.

If you are confused or concerned about something, you can ask right away!"
322,INFP,decider,"Hi, i'll try my best to type you!

>I just want to be happy, have fulfilling and loving relationships, be able to show the real ""naked"" me to the people I care about and them accepting me the way I am, I accepting them for who they are, even if it would be hard. I just want authenticity and mutual love and respect. Professionally, I want to earn enough to help support my loved ones, while also help people through work, whether it may be in a non-profit, consulting, government etc.

*That's the most Fi thing I ever heard it's not even funny..* You value authenticity and individuality. Fi doms are all about knowing their personal values. They are also the ones to usually help those they feel are undeserved in any way. Fi types may not be the best at expressing, but they find many ways to do it such as drawing, sports, dancing, creating, etc. 

>I like writing for self-expression, liberation of thoughts.  
I love movies just for the art of cinema, the characters, their stories, lives, love, adventure, lessons, All of it intrigues me,  
I enjoy going for walks and to the gym simply for the alone time, some thinking time, freedom from the day. 

More Fi üëÄ

>It's only important if expectations aren't being met, I guess. I do have trouble being efficient though.

Inferior Te. You show it when you 500% have to or is under stress. Expectations that aren't being met would stress out most people, but for Fi doms they would use Te for the sake of being efficient when there's no other choice.

I am going to say ISFP! I say this because you are a lot more physical oriented (Gym and other physical activities). I do notice more Se than Ne from you. I do take it you like to do activities that requires physical effort (correct me if I am wrong though lmao).

~~And you're just too pure, which is also a dead IxFP giveaway.~~"

335,INFJ,observer,"Tbh, though, he is already dismissing her as sensitive. Is this something she should even try to work out? I'm not so sure. Some of these comments he made about her to his friends are downright degrading and mean.

Ninja edit: Not to even mention talking about their sex life, wtf."

445,ENFP,observer,This is so interesting to me because so many empaths like to listen to sad music and I‚Äôm the opposite. I HATE it.

Then fully accepting undeniable truths, such as my sexual orientation, and not hiding that truth from family (especially extended, as they learned, mainly through adding me on Facebook) no matter the consequences.

Any strength I needed I found on my own, and through myself. To grow and evolve into who I am today, and to keep improving myself.

That all happened a decade ago. Feels like a long time since.

559,ESTP,observer,"What if he was replying to a comment that was replying to a post? When you press on the post yourself it's probably better formatted anyway. Also, OP mostly replies to type me posts, and he will have to copy and paste some large chunks and it's tougher for you to scroll down **and** find what actually was commented by OP which will be worse if he doesn't bold some sentences. OP may also think that his history presents his authentic self instead of those questions because he may not be self-aware.

Looking through his comment section is pretty much the same as reading through a chunk of answers to the megathread questions. I think that OP is actually making it easier for you since his thought process and preferences are easily shown through what he does in his history rather than some carefully chosen answers that may or may not show biasedness.

>MAKE you do the whole thing.

If someone's type me post provides less information than OP's history, it's even worse than what you suggested. Over here it's quality over quantity.

He made me a playlist of his favourite songs, and brought me a copy of his favourite book. We swapped real names and talked honestly about life and relationships. One night we met up in a bar and he hung out with my friends, stayed out all night and he crashed at mine. We were together for about two years. I quit sex work and went back to university, got a normal job. We moved in together, my family adored him and I got along really well with his mother. 

We broke up for pretty normal reasons, I wanted a responsible partner who I could build a life with, save money, be fit and healthy. He wanted to tour with the band, drink and party. Last time I saw him he was in and out of rehab and in some volatile relationship. I saw his mother last year and his business had failed, he hadn't been sticking with rehab and he was being charged with assaulting his ex-girlfriend. I really hope he manages to deal with his problems and get clean, I'm still thankful for the time we had and don't hold any grudges.

> **By ALL accounts, *Rhodes did not* inflict any of the mortal wounds upon any of the victims**‚Äîa mitigating circumstance. He did provide the weapons, the gloves and the transportation, with full knowledge of **what *Steven Woods* planned.**

Reddit has good intentions, but both sides of the story have to be heard.

**EDIT:** 

A lot of people keep referring me to Steven's account. Let me ask you this: If (as Steven claims) Marcus Rhodes was really the only one that killed these people, then what was his motive?

The websites above state that Steven had a motive: to kill a drug dealing rival.

Another point: Beth was killed because she witnessed the murder. If Steven truly had no part in the killing (and was as 'shocked' in the car as he says he was), why did Marcus not kill him, too, for being another supposed witness?

One key point is: **Steven ran to a different state (California) after the murders. If you were truly an innocent bystander to a murder (as he claims), why would you run?** Why not report it and immediately exonerate yourself, rather than run and risk blame?"

In terms of storywise as well as difficulty I feel Outcast is better tho'. But other than that outcast is better in almost everyway possible.

Also, although jedi academy is the sequel, you don't need to play outcast first to understand its plot, as the two connects only little."

679,INFP,decider,"I would love to adopt! Especially middle school aged children. I heard they could be challenging and get adopted far less often than infants and younger children. Plus I wouldn‚Äôt have to feel bad about bringing anyone into this crazy world because they would have already been brought into it by someone else. I think they‚Äôre in great need of love and patience, but they‚Äôre old enough to not need extreme levels of care taking around the clock. I feel I could both live my life and while also getting to share love with kids as a parent.

Oftentimes a control freak is just a fucking neurotypical control freak, can we just leave the diagnoses to the professionals? 

Honestly I'm just tired of armchair psychologists immediately diagnosing anyone who falls outside of social norms as autistic. It's become a catchall for undesirable social stupidity instead of a legitimate and highly specific cluster of traits. Unless you are a practicing mental healthcare professional and they're your patient, you shouldn't be making these calls, period, and doing so is pure ignorance, especially when you're talking about abusers and other criminals.

723,ENFP,observer,"If he is already being seen at cahms then you should be able to get them to refer him to gids, the gender clinic. After that there will be a very long wait (mine was about a year and a half but now I have had a few appointments and it goes quite quick) and then there is an assessment period of 6 ish meetings to determine what he wants to do and if anything else needs to be put in place and this will probably take 6 months or a bit longer. Then I'm pretty sure that if wanted you can get referred from gids to a gids endocrinologist and they sort out hormone blockers and hormone replacement therapy (testosterone) which I don't think takes very long (I haven't got to this point so I'm not really sure but from my understanding this is what happens). You have to be on hormone blockers for a year before you can get hrt and you also have ot be 16.

727,INTP,decider,"For me you seem a lot like a 7. You have way more reasons on 7 then in 9. 

About why you think you may not be a 7, it sounds a lot like 7's virtue, sobriety, when you're mostly satisfied with your life but can still perceive and accept the negative experiences as an important part of it. And your strong mind probably comes from your 8 wing

I actually didn't understand what you said about having something wrong in your mind, but I don't think I'd have much to add on that anyway.

Anyway, I suppose one of my biggest fears is to finish an ""unfulfilled"" life, and unhappy with what I've done with my time. I guess this ressembles more the seven's fear, deprivation, but I'm not sure, because I don't totally understand the meaning that ""deprivation"" has in this case."

So now I really don't know what is coming, and I'm exited.

About Lucy saying she was afraid of Natsu's flames, she may be right, since those flames came from Ignia, who doesn't seem to mean any good. And, of course, there's the odd possibility of END. Other than that, I think there's no need for her to worry about him, since violent and lacking control is just the way Natsu always fights."

738,INTJ,observer,"This is a cultural thing I guess. I'm Yoruba and the only reason I could possibly throw my grand mother out of the house is if living with her is an absolute nightmare. Even if my grandmother had a billion dollar life insurance policy and planned on leaving nothing for me after dying, I wouldn't kick her out of my house or even see that as a reasonable option (I mean, to be honest if I was in dire need for cash and she pulled that, I would be pissed, and the idea would certainly flash through my head more than once, but I wouldn't go through with it or even think it reasonable).

It's less of an ""offence"" and more of, should I say, a ""withholding"" of what most people should give. And while that's a shame, if you aren't taking care of someone to get something then while you might feel hurt (which is perfectly understandable), you shouldn't react that way."

740,INTJ,observer,"*The Decameron* by Giovanni Boccaccio.

The stories of first day to the third or so were nice and engaging, and they do a good job of putting the reader in the atmosphere of the Middle Ages. Those of the fourth and some of the fifth, however, were somewhat painful to read. I say painful because while I'm sure the stories were particularly engaging when they were written, the romanticizing of cheating in the name of love put me off immensely. I was practically waiting for the fourth day to end. I think I can understand why affairs are glamorized, however. Unless I'm mistaken, taken from what the book has said so far as well as prior knowledge, arranged marriages were the norm (especially in the upper classes) in those days. Marriages born out of love were a lot rarer than today. Compounding this was the social requirement of marrying a partner befitting one's class. Finally is how women seemed to have little say in who they married. This is just my guess using the little I've picked up from the book as well as general knowledge I'm not sure how I know (it could be TV and a bit of other things I've read for all I know)

Considering how the book is written for women, I suppose it makes a lot of sense that while one can find many instances of women cheating on their husbands, instances of husbands cheating on their wives are nonexistent. At least, so far. Still, I'm only on the sixth day. Let's see what the rest of the story holds."

815,ISTP,decider,"Years ago, I unlocked the Crystal Cruiser using the Descent Into Darkness mod, which replaces all ships with a single one that you can customize to your liking at the start of the game, and it gives you the option to have a Crystal crew member. For a long while, I've banned myself from using the Crystal Cruiser until I unlock it in vanilla FTL. I've finally done it! (yes I know the Rock C is basically the exact same thing as what I did way back when, but it's in vanilla FTL so I'm counting it.)"

Normal difficulty, AE enabled (obviously). Final score was 5008. Second ever 5k run!"
818,ISTP,decider,Not what one would expect to find on this sub but awesome at the same time
819,ISTP,decider,"I lost most of my crew to an oxygen crisis thanks to a boarding drone early in sector 8, and still won. Dunno how the hell I pulled it off.

I'd been consistently dying to the flagship stages 2 and 3 because my ship would never be able to handle the power surges/missiles/mind control+boarder swarm. I decided to try something unorthodox and get a teleporter, even though the Stealth B is *definitely* not a ""boarding"" style ship. I used the old fashioned ""kill all of its crew"" strategy and even with 3 crew (mantis+human boarding party) it worked beautifully.

Final score was 4561. Normal difficulty, AE enabled.

In any case, I'm getting a teleporter every run I can from now on, regardless of ship."

Amber reminds me of Katniss in the way they both received so much unexpected support and love from the public, but the books mentioned that the public started wearing their hair in Katniss's braid after she won, and it kinda makes me wonder if Molly Mae's bun would've caught on with the public had she won lol"

852,INFP,decider,"NAH. I think you have good intentions, and I understand why you want to have 1 on 1 time with your son. 

Your daughter's young, however, and judging by the fact by what your wife said, it sounds like your daughter feels hurt by your actions and told your mother so. I think most children at this age would feel upset if their father did something like that, and I wouldn't be surprised if she feels or grows up to feel as if you favour her brother. You should try putting away a little more time for just her, imo; I know your family plays games together  frequently, but having 1 on 1 time on the PS4 with your daughter *as well* as with your son may make her feel less excluded, whilst still providing your son with the 1 on 1 time he needs."

921,INTJ,observer,"I, too, have a teleporting 120 lb dog.  It's a running joke at our place.  Someone will put both the dogs outside, and some time later she is inside with no one admitting to having let her in.  Sometimes she'll be outside when no one has let her out.  We have two dogs, and every single time this happens, she'll be alone with the other one outside/inside - and they're normally let out/in together.  No dog doors and we don't leave the doors open without the screens shut.

I don't really think she's teleporting (I hope she's not, the ramifications are terrifying), but I seriously have no rational explanation for it unless someone in the house is developing dementia or amnesia and doesn't like the other dog."

929,INFJ,observer,"Not all humans are victims of the undead curse; there are other kingdoms outside of Lordran where being undead is stigmatized and being fully human is normal. Those without the curse die normally and leave a body behind. That's one theory that explains the bodies. 

Another theory is that when an undead dies, their corpse remains there until they respawn at the last bonfire. While this is highly unlikely, it's still technically possible.

There is a third possibility, though, and it's a much darker one. You know those hollows in that first area of the New Londo Ruins? They're not aggressive, they're sad and afraid. They're also *stationary, never moving even if you hit them*. So it could be that all the ""corpses"" around Lordran are actually hollows that have *completely* broken, so disheartened and miserable and numb that they simply lie there, unmoving, forever. It's the next step after becoming similar to the New Londo hollows. They just don't--or can't--care enough to stop you when you take items off them, so we assume they're corpses and treat them as such. When you think of them that way, the game changes quite a bit, doesn't it?

952,INTJ,observer,"My problem with TRP is, they are all about effort. It's ultimately a list of all the things you need to do to hopefully qualify for female attention. It's no different than the blue pill apart from the items on the list.

It's also a coping mechanism for physically unattractive guys who hope they can lift, work, lie and posture their way into what comes effortlessly for tall, good looking, confident men.

MGTOW is ironically also the optimal ideology for attracting women. Fuck effort, don't give a shit about them. Direct your energy toward obtaining the life you want to live. If any of them like you, your indifference will only make them work harder for your attention. If not, there's not much you could have done about it anyway."
953,INTJ,observer,"You have a flawed understanding of masculinity. Masculine men don't listen to manly music, they listen to whatever they like and make no apologies for it.

961,ESTJ,decider,"For enneagram, the way I see it is looking for the sun that their behavior revolves around. 

For example, I was in school with a 3w4 that I didn‚Äôt like too much. He was pretty highly regarded among most of our peers, but spent an awful lot of time behaving like he was trying to prove something to me or get me to admit his superiority in some area. As someone who generally doesn‚Äôt give a shit if people like them or care about proving myself to someone that clearly doesn‚Äôt want to be around me, my brain flagged this behavior. And when I looked a little deeper (starting paying attention to the language he used with others, the way he would talk about certain things he was good at, how he reacted to praise etc etc), the 3 was the obvious sun that he revolved around. 

In regards to narrowing, I‚Äôd say I rarely immediately know someone‚Äôs full type and enneagram right off the bat. I personally think many enneagrams look similar (3w4 versus 4w3, etc) so generally I narrow it as ‚Äúthey‚Äôre either this or that‚Äù and pay a little closer attention to ultimately identify their core need. 

As a last side note, I‚Äôd say that enneagram (at least to me) feels incomplete without doing the MBTI typing alongside it or before. I think they work best supplementally and fill in each other‚Äôs gaps."

1031,INTJ,observer,"Scripture seems to have pretty high standards for itself in terms of communicating a lot of content with great brevity.

However, there are a few proverbs which I think are funny in a dry kind of way

""Let your foot be rarely in your neighbor's house, lest he become weary of you and hate you'"" Prov 25:17

Or

 ‚ÄúBad, bad,‚Äù says the buyer, but when he goes away, then he boasts."" Prov 20:14"
1032,INTJ,observer,"Good question!

The term actually has different meanings in different places.

In Israel, most believers would call themselves Messianic rather than Christian, as the term is much less loaded with potential negative connotation. This is quite a fair thing to do, esp. as 'Christ' comes from the Greek translation of the word Messiah.

In America there is a strong Messianic movement which is essentially a group of people moving back to the Jewish roots of the faith.

The range here is quite significant. Some people enjoy the odd Jewish feast for fun, and like to learn more about the Old Testament, etc.

On the other hand, you can get people doing things like: calling themselves Jews when they aren't biologically, moving back into legalism, or having a significant superiority complex. There can sometimes be a very painful culture of people being almost bizarrely attached to the minutia of Jewish tradition, even more so than Messianic believers in Israel.

Outside of the States this range exists as well, although there's probably a lower concentration of what you might call 'hard-core' Messianic culture.

Having had a little bit to do with different people in these ranges, I think there's a lot to gain from the understandings of people in the Messianic movement, but also a fair bit of peril in sacrificing the Centrality of Christ on the altar of Jewishness."

I think God uses weaknesses like this in our lives to help us depend on His strength, which isn't something we do by default! Our natural response to our own failures is to just try and come up with clever techniques from our own strength to try harder.
Paul talks about this problem in Romans.

Romans 7:18-19 says:
18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. 19 For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. 

I would really highly recommend that you do a really decent Bible study into Romans to look at this. One great book to explain this topic is called ""Lifetime Guarantee"" by a guy called Bill Gillham.

1053,INTJ,observer,"So a virus is at the basic level a DNA or RNA strand that wants to keep multiplying.

How does it do that? Unlike bacteria, it has no organelles, or any means of obtaining resources or energy to both create new virus babies. 

A virus (bacteriophage, in this example) will use its attachment 'legs' to grab a bacteria, lower its 'head' into it, and inject its DNA (or RNA) into the bacterial host, where the virus USES the metabolic processes of the bacterial host as well as the DNA/RNA replication, protein synthesis factories to create hundreds of new baby viruses inside the bacterial host. 

After some time, or after a given termination point, the bacterial host basically explodes and releases more viruses that go on to affect other bacteria/hosts.

Imagine a fly that can burrow into your heart, drinks your blood and stores a ton of baby flies that are created using your own bodily proteins and resources and explodes out of your chest killing you, and releasing hundreds of baby flies that look for other people.

Changing a story makes it lose credibility and impact. It makes everything from there no better than a fanfiction. Once I heard Shirley was suddenly never killed, I lost almost all faith in R3. The only people who enjoy this change are those that simply didn't want to accept her death. THAT is judging by what you ""personally want"".

Furthermore, her death is important in shaping the story and made Code Geass so powerful in its themes. Lelouch learning that there are consequences for his actions, becoming more determined nonetheless, his turn to Zero Requiem--her death was influential factor in it all. If they couldn't incorporate it all due to running time--well, maybe there shouldn't have been movies to begin with? No one asked for them.       "

1093,INFP,decider,"The designers did think of this. There is a reason they didn't go with it.

1: Lots of stages in that tab would be impossible

2: Impossible stages would lower player morale, and make them want to go else where

3: Good stage creators play every section of their stage dozens of times before upload. They wanted to make you playtest at least once.

4:  If a creator does not playtest their stage, it's possible that (unintentionally) the stage really is impossible. Your entire description here makes me think you don't playtest actively, which leads me to believe some of your stages, in reality, may be unbeatable, and possibly even unpolished. You can't just force half of the making duty onto someone else.

5: ""Nintendo is stealing form you?"" I'm not sure if I was supposed to, but I find this a little bit funny. It's not Nintendo fault that you play kaizo badly. I don't want to be rude, but that's the truth here, you're making stages that are waaay harder than your skill level, then blaming Nintendo when you can't beat them.

6: You payed 100$ dollars for the game? Did it go out of sale at your shop or something?

7: (not exact quote) ""I feel like Nintendo is stealing the core game from me (level creation and upload)""
There are so many things wrong with  this sentence. First of all, they're not stealing anything. Not everyone can have the same skill as big time streamers. If anything, your skill stole it away from you‚Äîand I get it! I also suck at kaizo and can't upload kaizo. That's not Nintendo's fault, though. That's because I suck at the game.

In no particular order.

* Reddit is Lust, a highly addictive and indulgent platform that tempts users with knowledge and ruins their lives with memes.
* TVTropes is Sloth, due to its uncanny ability to drain one's time.
* Snapchat is Pride, due to the frivolous self-indulgence it represents by its very existence.
* Instagram is Envy, due to the vanity and vote obsession it creates, often breeding rivals from friends.
* Facebook is Wrath, a volatile platform that stands both as a useful tool for expression and a means of aggressive self-destruction.
* Buzzfeed is Greed, a modern sensationalist news platform that profits off of misinforming and wasting the time of the lowest common denominator.
* 4chan is Gluttony, a growling beast that devours all mercy and innocence that dare approach it."
1156,INFP,decider,"Dune might well be my favourite book of all time; it's certainly one of them, at least. The level of thematic and philosophical depth contained within the story is honestly mind-boggling and the world-building is second to none. While it's not without its flaws, the lack of relatable characters and stilted dialogue coming to mind, Dune is undeniably a masterwork of literature.

The sequels are excellent too, in a slightly different way. Dune itself is an incredible stand-alone, and perhaps the best story in the series, but the sequels through God-Emperor at least expand on its philosophical depth to an enormous degree. I would recommend them to any reader of the first book who wants to see the story continued or its ideas expanded upon, but would caution that they often completely lack the human element that Dune is already kind of shaky with.

So, yeah. Incredible book, and equally incredible philosophical dissertation. Dune isn't just a novel; it's a feat of storytelling and deserves to be recorded as not just a classic of the genre but a classic of literature, period."

In my experience, highly intelligent people spend less time asserting their intelligence (unless they're very insecure) and more time trying to teach and learn from other people. They recognize that while they are smart, there are people who are smarter, and even those far less intelligent than them can still teach them things. This guy does not. Instead, he boasts about how much better he is than everyone else in the most pathetic, validation-seeking manner he can."
1164,INFP,decider,"Having played both WoW and GW2 (albeit the latter in mostly PvP), I agree wholeheartedly. The games are built around fundamentally different philosophies. Guild Wars 2 characters have infinitely more tools available to them than WoW characters when it comes to avoiding, ignoring and cheesing mechanics. GW2 also allows players to be a lot more self sufficient; in WoW, players are dependent upon each other for survival while in GW2, the action combat and self-healing systems allow players to take care of themselves in many circumstances.

Another critical point is that of the downed state; in GW2, players don't immediately die upon reaching zero hit points and in fact cannot be instantly killed by any source whatsoever (though there may be some boss mechanics that subvert this). While brilliant design from a PvP perspective, the existence of the downed state makes failure a lot more forgiving. Rather than a limited number of combat resurrections spread across a large group, GW2 allows for liberal combat rezzes in most situations.

When it comes down to it, WoW is more forceful and less forgiving when it comes to encounter and character design. WoW players have a consistent and limited set of resources available to them in any given situation, and bosses are designed around this fact. Not just limited on a per-player basis but on a raid-wide one. Take Bloodlust, for example, a buff given out by Shamans (well, and some others). It's extremely powerful, but when received, it puts a debuff on players that prevents them from receiving Bloodlust again for a period that is far longer than the duration of the spell. Take all the Shamans you like, you're not getting more Bloodlust.

Blizzard understands exactly what your characters are capable of doing, and because of the way WoW works, you're playing on their terms. If they want a mechanic to be impossible to ignore, it will be, because no well-timed dodge can save you from a nuclear explosion. Well, maybe if you're a rogue with Cloak of Shadows, but you can't build a raid out of rogues. If a boss requires a tank-swap because of a stacking bleed, that bleed will be incurable. WoW is designed around rigid, hard-set rules. They can be mitigated at times and broken in very specific situations, but they aren't ""soft"" rules like GW2's.

Don't get me wrong, I love GW2. But it's a different game, a more forgiving game. It's a game that gives players agency, allows for significant errors. and presents problems that have more than one solution.

/u/GW2Bergal, [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tbf87mPWuA) are [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38U4RAxhCTE) boss guides that in my mind, exemplify high-end WoW raiding. The first is Mythic Kil'Jaeden, undoubtedly the hardest and least forgiving boss in the current expansion. The second is Heroic Siegecrafter Blackfuse, a boss from two expansions ago who nonetheless demonstrates the extreme degree of mechanical complexity to some WoW bosses. I think these bosses highlight just how important the mechanics are to WoW raid bosses, and how strict they can often be."
1165,INFP,decider,"Attempting to usurp the Dreamer, the local creator goddess. It's entirely possible; in fact, Alivus II succeeded in doing so. The ritual isn't even that hard, if you can get your hands on her body and have access to several hundred experienced spellcasters. It's not really a good idea, though. The Dreamer is totally detached from the suffering of humanity; in fact, she'd probably rather us rot away to nothing than anything else. And that's a good thing.

Let's just say there's a reason that the Blood Gods of old forced the Dreamer into a sleeping state, where she can only muster occasional semi-conscious actions. The Dreamer has all the powers of infinity, but none of the omniscience necessary to use it. Because of this, her attempts to create perfection will inevitably fail. So what's the point I'm getting at? As Alivus II found out rather harshly, no mind is capable of comprehending infinity. It doesn't matter what your intentions are; attempting to wield the power of creation will result in catastrophe as you unknowingly break the laws of the universe.

So, yeah. You can absolutely become God. Unfortunately, not even God is smart enough to *be* God, so what makes you think you are? Unless you want to sleep forever, knowing that your dreams and desires will subtly reshape the world around you, but you can never awake to direct them, I do not recommend it. You could become the Devourer instead, and be able to destroy anything. That's a limited infinity, so humans can understand it. Unfortunately, you will be totally isolated, unable to even *speak* properly, left to act as your race's silent and despised protector, just as the Devourer does now. So altogether, becoming a Cosmic Twin? Not recommended. "

1189,ENFP,observer,"I've dealt with this a lot over the past year, and I have found a few tools that have greatly benefitted me.   
One is simply using your natural voice. Often, when anxious or pretending, we subconsciously change our voice to fit our facade. Simply focusing on using our natural tone of voice can help us feel more relaxed, independent, and more ourselves.  
The next one is similar. Only act as energetic as you *are*. You DO NOT have to pretend to be excited about everything. You DO NOT have to smile and laugh all the time. Nobody does that naturally. Sometimes I think we mistake the absence of a positive reaction for a sign of inner weakness and turmoil, so we quickly cover it up with a laugh and a smile, and this quickly can become toxic, as maintaining it can be an immense drain on our well being and stamina. To instead focus on reacting naturally and only acting as energetic as we feel, we can regain a lot of confidence, because we can own what's real, not something made up that could crack any second.  
This leads to the final and most important thing, *own the things that make you* ***you.*** As I have observed people, I have noticed the thing that sets apart those who are not themselves and those who are is the fact that they own their qualities, and not in a cheesy, love yourself even if you're awful kind of way. You have to be comfortable enough with who you are to make fun of yourself and laugh the hardest out of all of them. This doesn't mean you have to like everything about yourself, that would be incredibly vain and unhealthy. We all have flaws, and it is healthy to want to solve our issues. But it is important to remember that EVERYONE is dealing with the same stuff. It's nothing new, nothing more horrendous, nothing less solvable than things others have gone through and conquered before you. Once you realize this, it can help to make your tasks a little less daunting, and a little more tame and normal, even funny!

Finally finally finally, accept that you will not be able to do any of this sometimes. There will be times when your brain just won't have any of it. That is the time to cool down, take a break, refresh, and wait for your feelings to pass. The most important thing is to not be mad at yourself for your feelings, let them come and go, and deal with them accordingly when you can. 

You are a beautiful human soul out there in the universe somewhere, and I believe you can do this. Everyone can."

1193,INTP,decider,I'm not gonna try and glorify angsty joker idolizing lnstagram 14 year old here. But part of what made Heath Ledgers joker such a great villain is because he actually did manage to prove that he was right at the end of the movie therefore achieving his goals by the time the movie had ended.
1194,INTP,decider,"The Joker wanted to prove that him and every other human being are not as different as it would seem and that they were all just one crappy day, one traumatic event from becoming just as evil as him.

He proved this by causing a situation in which he put Harvey Dent and Rachel in two separate areas filled with dynamite and giving Batman time only to save one of them. Batman tries to save Rachel but in a genius move, the Joker switched the addresses of the captives causing Rachel to be the one who dies as Batman can now only save Harvey.

In the aftermath of this event Harvey Dent doesn't only bear physical scars as the explosion caused half of his to blown off, but emotional scars as well due to the fact that he loved Rachel. He then becomes insane turning into the classic villain Two-Face.

This is in the end proves the Jokers point because he managed to prove that through shaking his life up in the just the right way, he was able to turn Harvey from the earnest and goodwill idealist he once was into an evil sociopathic murderer."

1248,INTP,decider,Lol even I fell into that mindset pre Vokrii.
1249,INTP,decider,"Another inconsistency (not really the right word for it perhaps) is that Imperials have experience and perk bonuses which are completely useless to npcs. Claw damage on Khajiits is ridiculously strong on Legendary difficulty. Personally I'd like to see Enai bring Morningstar a bit closer to Imperious in some ways, such as changing the racial base stats, but still keep it minimalist.  It gets rid of some inconsistencies like you said, but adds on others in their place, although not as bad.

Just realized I'm talking to you, that's cool. Just want to say huge fan of your work, and don't take my disagreements in design the wrong way. It really just comes down to personal preference, which is why I included both of your race mods in my list.

Edit: I should clarify that Khajiit claws combined with their increased movement speed is overpowered. Not saying you should get rid of either of those but perhaps lowering them wouldn't be a bad idea.

Also I would say that you should keep the spell absorb Bretons have since probably most of the people using Morningstar approach Skyrim modding with a minimalist mindset. That being said I'm unaware of just how many complaints you got for someone else's mistake/decision.  


Edit 2 : I guess the Imperial bonus really isn't bad at all and most of the things about Morningstar are things I like. It's just feels like it so close to my idea of a perfect race mod, but just not quite there yet."

1. How am I supposed to interpret what you mean by the drums sounding loose?

2. The snare can't possibly have too much reverb if I didn't put any reverb on it. If the snare was dropped 3 to 6 dB you wouldn't be able to hear it at all.

3. Where is the mud? What frequency range? 

4.  Where do they get lost in the mix? Timestamps?

And lastly may I ask what device you're listening on? Does it have any low or high end boosts?

Once again, I promise I'm not trying to be a dick about this."

1267,INTP,decider,"I'm also in my 3rd year of college but I'll share stuff what I've searched upon and found useful. Most of them are gonna be specific to engineering.

First decide on what you like, what in CS interests you the most, because you're gonna get a job on a specific role. You can be a fullstack developer as well but being focussed on something specific will make you learn stuff accordingly.

Watch this video to know about the types of engineers in CS:
https://youtu.be/_9ZS6q4996g

After you've decided what you like, learn about that particular thing i.e the different tools and frameworks.

I'm interested in data science so I've been learning stuff like machine learning, data science which involves python, and tools like numpy, scikit learn, Tensorflow etc.
But before learning these frameworks I learnt the basic concept behind machine learning since it involves a lot of math.
Then I started to make small implementations of what I learnt in python. I hope to make bigger stuff during my semester break.

Now since I want to be a data scientist, I don't require proficiency in stuff like java or C#. That's why it's important to chose a track you like.
While developing machine learning projects I need to deploy what I made, so for that I learnt Flask, which is a framework for back end web dev in python. This way I'm learning relevant technologies.

Java is used in a lot of places from back end web dev to android dev. If you want to work on Java, I'd suggest subscribing and following upon related subreddits and youtube channels to know what stuff people work upon in java. Do the same if you decide to work on any other track. Dedicate whatever free time you can give to this. Afterwards try finding an internship or contribute to open source projects and such to showcase your skill level and various tech you know. Cheers!"

99% of the time this is not the case, but in this specific case it seems to have been largely positive.

Humans in history have largely been non monogamous, and the ideas of monogamy have only been practiced for a few hundred years.

Yes it's a social contract between two people that agrees to certain standards, but it's also a human contract. Humans are not perfect but they will often do what they think is right.

Just... please, if you haven't seen it, go see it."

1430,ISFJ,observer,"It's difficult to really summarize the ""weird parts.""  The thing about the film that's so cringeworthy and stress-inducing has more to do with the character's social anxiety - she's awkward, and you can really feel her awkwardness coming through the screen, you know?

1464,INFP,decider,The farm storyline and the G&G storyline are both interesting. I just hope it's not related. I think it's not much of a plot twist if the Gargoyle King is Mr. Evernever.

In the company I'm working at, they're aiming for work equality that they want 50% of the employees to be women. I'm a software engineer, I think it's fine if most of the employees are men. There are just more men that are interested in programming. Nothing wrong with that.

Birthday's aren't a prime time to criticize someone with a loaded present.The shoes idea sounds good, or even a gift card to Dick's sporting goods. Or give her cash and keep yourself from being overly invested in what she does with it. If you want to get her a food scale, I'd do it another time and make something up like 'I accidentally ordered two, do you want one?'. "
1482,ENTP,observer,"What I have learned in evolutionary psychology classes in favor of light eye color is that it allowed men with light eyes to be reasonably sure of the paternity of their offspring. If a man had light eyes and his mate had light eyes, it could raise questions if their children had dark eyes.  
Also, pupil dilation can be an indicator of sexual interest. It is much easier to distinguish this sign of attraction in those with lighter irises. It is also easier to see increased bloodflow/blushing that can indicate attraction and arousal in lighter-skinned individuals.  
Light skin (like large breasts) is  one of those traits that makes it easier to gauge the age of a potential mate. Without the sun-protective effects of much melanin, light skin shows spots and wrinkles quickly. Likewise, in a time without bras, large breasts that had not started to sag could indicate both fertility and youth.  
Hormonal changes at puberty trigger slight changes in skin color in men and women. Men become slightly darker-skinned, and women slightly lighter. Exaggerating the differences between men and women seems like it has been a tactic to increase attractiveness in many cultures over time."

1486,ENTP,observer,"Maybe I'm not incredibly observant, but my other lifestyle habits rarely seem to affect the way my skin looks or behaves. If I'm drinking a lot of green and herbal teas it can look a little nicer. If I'm on a huge vegetable kick in the summer my skin gets a yellowish tinge/carotenoid glow.  
 
Eating lots of sugar, dairy, and greasy processed foods makes me feel like crap after a while, but my skin doesn't tell on me. On the other hand there are a lot of healthyish foods like tofu and steam-in-bag broccoli I continue to eat because I like them, even when I'm eating junk like peanut butter cups and french fries in the evenings too. I have noticed that when I've been eating well for a while that the color of my tongue looks darker and healthier. "

I also did the same as you -- took a few years getting to know myself via living alone, understanding my preferences, treating myself well (dating myself too), and honoring my boundaries. I worked on my passion/hobbies/personal goals enough to know it wasn't something I would drop for an SO.

1563,ESTP,observer,"I think it more has to do with needs, expectations and willingness to accept change. 

Positive change is very easy to accept. If I won the lottery, awesome I‚Äôm cool with that. Negative change is harder to accept as it threatens our needs and our expectations. 

I think there is a evolutionary tendency for people to be comfortable with a way of life that keeps them alive. We live in a world where our needs to live are easily met. However, any threat to that way of life, misfires that hormonal response to a degree where we feel our world in crumbling down and we need to adapt in order to survive. Even if it would be very easy for us to survive. 

The truth is, the world is a unforgiving place. A lot of people aren‚Äôt willing to accept that. The world wasn‚Äôt made to enjoy, but made to survive and overcome. Negative experiences only bring you closer to that realization. As negative things are only negative if you are unprepared or unable to accept them. 

If you see the world as a fantasy land you‚Äôll live your life forever disappointed, but if you see the world and its potential to be cruel you can prepare and adapt, and that is the only way you can be truly grateful for the positive things that enter your life.

That's like the opposite of what a yoga teacher should be."

1574,INFP,decider,"Not justifying it, but the fact that you're referring to a woman (potentially) having casual sex being a ""slut"" might have something/everything to do with that."
1575,INFP,decider,"Good seduction is all about anticipation and teasing! Having the discipline to make you want more in my opinion! I think women tend to have a bit of an edge in this since a lot of us are conditioned to not be very direct, but everyone can learn! Imply without actually giving it away or being 100% direct, so it engages her mind and she literally can't help but think about it. ""What did that mean?"" Lots of body language. Like I might brush my hand softly on my thigh, so the gaze is just naturally drawn to that area and they start thinking more about it. Deeply inhale and exhale once softly on her ear, so she wonders what it would sound like to hear you panting and moaning softly into it. Give a single, big stretch, showing off your height and size for a second, so she wonders what it might possibly look like to have that looming over her.

Anticipation tends to be the difference between bodies thrown against the wall, hands everywhere, steamy amazing sex, and ""eh."" Food tastes better if you're really hungry for it, right? ;) Foreplay for me is really just finding ways to make your mouth water."
1576,INFP,decider,"This. 

I was giving up a lot, the only one working, they were never happy with anything I did. I found out my ex apparently complained to his ex about me being depressed, told her he kicked me out, among other things, and lied and denied it when I confronted him about it. 

That was when I permanently fell out of love with that person, and realized that I couldn't deny the fact that I was dating a monster any more. Any love, trust,  attraction, loyalty, effort and respect for that person instantly died, and I was so utterly repulsed and disgusted by this person being allowed to be so close to me in my life that I almost literally vomited. He made me sick in every sense of the word. I gave him a chance to show me if there was actually anything in it for me if I stayed. There literally wasn't."
1577,INFP,decider,That just sounds like karma haha.

1700,ENTP,observer,"The game is pretty healthy right now. It went through a very dark age for a while where it received no updates for a long time and it was gravely imbalanced but things are looking up again now. We are in one of the healthiest metas I've ever seen and I've been playing this game since beta.

A lot of players are concerned though that DireWolf seems to have little interest in organizing competitive tournaments. Although this game recently recieved an expansion and a small update it is very infrequently updated and can sometimes go months without any new content.

1703,INTJ,observer,"Wow, his profile is instantly recognizable."
1704,INTJ,observer,"Wow, that's horrible and I'm sorry to hear it. I wonder if it's at least partly an eye contact issue? (When you applied originally, did you either meet with or video chat with them? If not, then I don't know what to say.) Eye contact is a big part of how NTs assess honesty. That's why being ""shifty-eyed"" is considered to be a bad thing. Body language is important too--slouching is considered bad, for example. Maybe the department head had an especially bad--one even might say prejudicial--reaction to lack of NT levels of eye contact and body language. As far as her saying others agreed with her, I'd take that with a grain of salt, especially if she as department head was imposing her opinions on others and expecting agreement.

Anyway, if this is it, it's possible to train yourself to improve your eye contact and be more aware of your body language. That's pretty much the extent of my thoughts on the matter, I hope it's at least somewhat helpful."
1705,INTJ,observer,"Ok, I'm a huge huge Beatles fan. Love them to bits and have listened their albums into the dust. As a kid, their entire catalogue was sacrosanct and I'd never criticize any of it.

1709,INTJ,observer,"Based on what you've said about this departmental head, it sounds like she doesn't have your best interest at heart. Instead of being honest with you, perhaps she was just trying to justify her own prejudice and get you to leave her office. So unless I saw the letter in question, I'd doubt her claims. Is there a way you can get a copy of the letter? If your letter writer actually said that, that's not cool; if she felt that way, she should've been upfront and said she couldn't give a recommendation. At any rate, see if you can get copies of all letters of recommendation before  applying elsewhere. Best wishes, don't let these jerks get you down!"
1710,INTJ,observer,"The Nerk Twins. 

I love, love, love the phenomenal hybrid that is Lennon/McCartney. The musical and personal chemistry between them powered the engine that ran the greatest rock band of all time. Together they were magical. There are things I love about each of them separately, but the reason I love The Beatles so much is because I love them as a pair. The influence they had on each other was incalculably profound: to pick John is to pick someone who was deeply, deeply influenced by Paul, and to pick Paul is to pick someone who was deeply, deeply influenced by John."
1711,INTJ,observer,"Oh, I hate that question. I never know what people are getting at or why they're asking. Now, instead of answering, when someone asks what I'm doing later, I just ask, ""Why?"" That forces them to get to the point, so I know how to answer. "

retarded idea. high doses/repeated use of diphenhydramine has been shown to increase risk of dementia signifigantly, correlation doesn't equal causation etc etc but i wouldn't play around with this shit. dementia is not worth whatever you think the benefits are, and there's much better and safer drugs to use instead. dxm or other dissociatives are well known for anti depressant and introspective effects, and psychedelics also have value as a tool for a sort of 'brain reboot' in the same sense. don't worry about it know but stop doing this shit, benadryl isn't enjoyable, is less effective for entheogenic purposes, and has serious risks."

Edit: word"
1726,ENTP,observer,"Siiiiiigh. Ok. Here goes.

This is brilliant design. There I said it. And so is the Apple Pencil charging position. Because Apple designs through problems, not around them. 

I use both daily. Most charging configurations (I.e usb cords, docks) assume that during the course of charging you will either have to use the device while charging or putting it down. Why would that assumption be made?

Because of the simple, accepted, familiar fact that CHARGING TAKES A REALLY LONG TIME.

But while everybody else designs around that problem. They accommodate. They compromise. These are the constraints lets make it work.

Apple, on the other hand, takes a different approach. They say ""what is the absolute ideal of this device/experience."" And then work backwards. If you pay close attention to their design decisions you can see evidence of those thoughts.

Example 1. The battery indicator lights in MacBook pros. They disappear when not in use because Jony essentially asked ""what would the ideal be for indicator lights?"" And he decided the answer was ""in dictator lights should only appear when indicating something."" So he spent millions of apples dollars buying and engineering the CNC mills capable of milling those indicator light pipes out of their aluminum frames. Meanwhile, your Lenovo puts plastic lights on the surface that are there all the time. Big deal? Nah. But it's not ideal.

Example 2. This mouse. Prior to this mouse I owned a Logitech wireless mouse that had a charge port on its nose. It would die a few times a week and I plugged it in. So easy and convenient, right? Well, after a while I stopped unplugging it. It quickly became a very expensive wired mouse. Then I got this mouse. Laughed at the stupid port and regretted my decision. But after weeks of using it became clear that Apple made the brilliant decision to, instead of coping out with a shit battery and wired option, put in an amazing fast charge battery and removed the option of you using it tethered. This batter charges so fast that I have literally plugged the mouse in, held it there for a few moments, and then took the cord out and continued using the mouse for the rest of the day. It was a crazy sensation to not even have to take my hands off the device to get enough juice just like that.

This design makes a statement about usability, you can't use it while charging because you DONT HAVE TO. It's a simple and elegant way of informing the behavior of the user. And I love it.

My personal belief is that Apple design has only gotten better. Apple design hasn't died, but it's sales man has. If Steve Jobs was alive I would never had to figure out what was great about the mouse on my own. He would have told me.

EDIT: I'm getting a lot of questions on my thoughts on the headphone jack. Honestly, I was just venting and looking forward to downvoted oblivion. Pleasant surprised that people are reacting positively. 

Guys, phones are really really powerful computers/machines packed into really really small cases. I say also machines because theres actually more moving parts than the average computers. You got all these sophisticated accelerometers, cameras, motors, gps's. All of the worlds most advanced sensors taken and scaled down to miniscule sizes that we all thought impossible just a few years ago. And then... we have the 3.5 mm headphone jack. A behemouth of antique analog technology taking up the equivalent of an entire city block in an over crowded borough. 

We need that space. You think you love the jack, but just try wireless headphones that actually work (I love mine, even though they aren't perfect. They make me really excited for the future). Watch what happens when we get rid of the crutch of wires, and the entire consumer electronic world kicks wireless innovation into the next gear. And watch what phones start doing with that little bit of extra leg room. It's a good move. I'm in favor.

Apple always builds towards the ideal. And Steve Jobs said the ideal was a single pane of glass. Period. A frameless, nearly weightless (just the right amount of weight) display that does nothing to distract the user from the content of the device. They will always work towards that ideal with every iteration. And that means removing things. The three rules of good design is 1) remove 2) remove 3) remove. Remove the redundant, the unnecessary and even the good things. You've got to remove a LOT of good things to make room for the better. That's the hardest part of great design. And Apple actually does it.

 I hope they get rid of the lightening input next."

1731,ENTP,observer,"I regularly work in Apple factories in China. (But never have been to Foxconn. ""Slave-like"" conditions they are not. They are easily the best facilities for miles in any direction. The workers are paid better than their peers, with benefits, work the same hours, and the mood is generally really upbeat even when there are tight deadlines. China, as a country is enjoying a strong surge in their economy and factory workers have a lot of power due to the fact they have plenty of jobs to choose from. So... I don't know where all this is coming from.

I mean, I've never been to Foxconn. But I'm really having a hard time imagining it could be that much worse than their other factories.

Why would OP be an asshole for not wanting to be involved in a situation where he made it clear that he didn't want to be involved in? It takes two to tango to raise a baby.

1777,INTJ,observer,"Yes, but I‚Äôm more-so talking about the symbolism from 2049. The LAPD mindset is to hunker down and let the dystopian chaos blow over them, which is shown by huge ocean waves crashing on the dam and the heavy rain beating against the windows. These images represent the human instinct to survive in adversity and weather the elements. On the other hand, the pools of water inside Wallace Corp are completely still and we can‚Äôt hear or see any rain. Here we have a mentality that seeks to control and transform the environment- to shape chaotic rain into a still pond. Wallace sees the human gift of reproduction not as a means of survival but as a natural resource that must be dominated. The final fight between Agent K and Luv takes place outside the dam where there is no longer shelter against the elements. It‚Äôs a fight of survivor against controller, but in a stroke of irony, the controller drowns in the uncontrollable forces of the ocean. There is an implied statement that the primitive force of self-preservation is what keeps us human and that the world will drown us in our desire to overpower it.

Edit: I can't take full credit for identifying this symbolism. Here's some watching material if you want other takes on water in BR2049:

1787,INTJ,observer,"Bad hygiene. Body odor or bad breath, greasy hair, plaque covered teeth, all major turn-offs."
1788,INTJ,observer,"This has to do with the body adjusting to a lower intake of energy from food but also not letting insulin fall enough to access fat stores. Let‚Äôs say you eat 3 meals a day with snacks in between, for instance. 

If you lower your calories but you‚Äôre still eating just as often, insulin still goes up each time you eat, however less so if you eat smaller portions and even less if you limit carbs/protein.  If you are eating, you are stimulating insulin, which is the hormone that enables your body to store fat. If you cut calories but still eat often your body will just adjust to the lower calorie intake by lowering your body heat and making you more tired. Eventually you might plateau. 

Fasting, however, keeps your insulin at the lowest levels possible and your body instead runs on its own fat, converting it to ketones for energy.

If you have lots of stored fat, your body recognizes that it now has lots of fuel and burns more energy, raising your metabolism and energy levels. 

Your body also becomes more sensitive to insulin  over time with fasting so you don‚Äôt need to produce as much, which would help keep the weight off easier long term."
1789,INTJ,observer,"Depends on your reason for fasting. Are you fasting for weight loss, for autophagy? If for weight loss only, I‚Äôve read you can eat up to 500 calories a day and still be considered ‚Äúfasting‚Äù. 

People in this sub will say unless you‚Äôve had black tea or coffee, only water is allowed.

If you were not feeling well, you definitely should not continue fasting. There‚Äôs no shame in eating and starting again. Your effort has not been lost."
1790,INTJ,observer,"It‚Äôs safer to break your fast with keto foods, and start out with something very small like a handful of nuts. Wait half an hour or so after eating something small before having a bigger meal."
1791,INTJ,observer,It‚Äôs much better to pause the fast and eat than to risk passing out or worse. 6-7 days is admirable even if you do decide to properly stop the fast now.

I remember we were trick-or-treating at this rich place with a lot of Indian people, and I asked this one lady, ‚ÄúDo you celebrate Halloween in India?‚Äù My 7w6 friend gave me a weird look. Next house had an Indian person, too, and I asked the same question, and he got even more nervous, which kept getting funnier and funnier. The next house had a white person answering the door.

‚ÄúDo they celebrate Halloween in India?‚Äù My 7w6 friend just walked away without a word and we both started bursting out laughing. I did the same thing at 14 consecutive houses and he eventually just put up with it with the most ‚ÄúFucking kill me‚Äù face, although he‚Äôd leave if it was an actual Indian person at the door. I asked him why he was so nervous, given that most of these people were actually Indian, and he just yelled ‚ÄúExactly! That‚Äôs exactly why!‚Äù

As for my 3w2 friend, he‚Äôs the most popular one out of the three of us. Me and my 7w6 the only one of the guys that doesn‚Äôt seem to suck up to him, which I‚Äôve always found funny, since it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs very threatening? Aside from physically being the weakest of of us, he‚Äôs also the most tolerant when it comes to being made fun of. Anyway, he tends to be ‚Äúairheaded charismatic,‚Äù where his attention span wanders while someone‚Äôs talking, and comedy ensures when he gets called out. We were at this one middle-aged woman‚Äôs house, and she starts talking to my 3w2 friend as she‚Äôs giving out candy.

W: ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

3w2: ‚ÄúHm? Oh, hi.‚Äù

W: ‚ÄúI said ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äô‚Äù

3w2: ‚ÄúOh, okay. My name is [name].‚Äù

W: ‚ÄúOh, okay.‚Äù

3w2: ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre good.‚Äù

W: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

My 7w6 friend started cracking up at the fact that they were having two different conversations, although I wasn‚Äôt paying attention myself. It‚Äôs funny in hindsight, but I was confused as hell when my best friend was trying to explain it to both of us when she closed the door.

As for me, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm the loudest of my friend group, mainly because I‚Äôm also the most physically hyperactive. I also enjoy pranking the others the most, like when me and my 7w6 friend pretended to be my 3w2 friend‚Äôs girlfriend over text when he got a new phone. It was great.

As for Halloween, aside from being an enabler to the rest of the guys, I mainly remember attaching a Reese‚Äôs Cup to a Beyblade spinner and having it explode, although that‚Äôs probably the tamest thing I did all night."

1837,INTJ,observer,"God I know, right?! 

And the dejection in new Clementine left all alone and not knowing what to do. 

Tragic. "
1838,INFJ,observer,"Specifically don't have an object focal point.  
Set it up so that your seating creates a nook where people face each other.  
Make people the focal point."
1839,INFJ,observer,"Yes, but it's much easier to clean up now."
1840,INFJ,observer,"I suppose that you could look at it this way if I were simply saying, ""The utility of my car has not been altered and therefore I don't care that someone has crashed into it.""  
But, really, it's more that I want to express how my relationship to objects has changed now that I've invested so much time into carefully considering which ones i want to keep.  I'm definitely not a stoic, generally speaking.  =p"
1841,INFJ,observer,"People refer to this as uniforming themselves.  It can be very effective for some.  Steve Jobs did this, for instance.    It does mean you never need to think, even for a moment, about what you're going to wear.      
       
I, however, do a much less stringent version.   Instead of doing a bunch of clothes that are exactly the same, I just make sure that I can wear anything I own with anything else I own.  It's going to look okay (cut and color) with anything else in the wardrobe.    A bit more thought goes into it.  But, it does give me variety, and a large number of combinations from a small number of clothes.  It also means if I'm in a hurry, I can grab anything without thinking about it and I'll still look okay for work.        "
1842,INFJ,observer,"Feeling that sense of regret as soon as you own something is probably something you can stop by more carefully considering whether or not you actually need it.  To avoid this, never buy anything just because it's on sale.  Try to put some time in between when you first decide you want a thing and when you actually buy it. Sure you want the thing this instant, but will you still feel so strongly in a week?  What if you had to wait two weeks before buying it? Would you still get it?  
   
As for everything you already own being garbage, I'm really not sure!  I don't think that's a good thing though.  I would analyze why you feel that way.  It is possible that you've latched onto the high that decluttering can give you when you let go of things. Owning only the things you love is more the point of minimalism than throwing away all of your things.  
   
I do want to offer another important possibly, however.  Many people find that as they embrace minimalism, they realize that they are holding into identities that are not really them.  They have clothes that make them blend in to other people's expectations- Objects they only have because other people think they should.   As you strip these things away, it is common for someone's, ""real self,"" to emerge.  
   
When this is the case, many people wind up hating their belongings because they tie them to their false identities.  It is common to wind up replacing those with things that you actually like.  I got rid of a lot of my old clothes when I first started and wound up buying different clothes that I actually liked.  There's no shame in this.  My closet now has only clothes that I actually enjoy wearing as a result.  
   
Minimalism is not synonymous with utilitarianism.  You're still going to own some things. Just make sure it's things worth owning.   =D"
1843,INFJ,observer,"Can I offer you an alternate point of view?  
Some items can definitely act as a catalyst for some people, myself included.  No one could look at my life 6 months ago and compare it to now and NOT know I've downsized massively.  That said, I definitely made some purchases along the way that helped. There's nothing wrong with 1 step back and 4 steps forward.  
   
Minimalism is NOT about how many things you own! It's about all the things you own being important and valuable to you.
   
1.  Most importantly, I bought a scanner.  As I'm an artist, I invested in a high quality art scanner.  I used it to scan all of my sentimental photographs so that I could get rid of boxes worth of them.  Space saved? Probably broke even.  However, the scanner also adds immense value to my life because now I can scan my art and stop keeping old sketches.  This is probably the easiest example I have.  
2.  I ditched all the clothes in my wardrobe that I disliked wearing.  Anything I didn't like the print or color of, anything that didn't fit perfectly, and anything that I didn't like the way the material felt on my skin.  This left my wardrobe profoundly sparse.  I'm not a fan of doing laundry several times a week.  I prefer once a week at most.  So I spent some time and money investing in a FEW, well chosen, deliberate purchases for my wardrobe.  I have no regrets.  My wardrobe is still, ""Minimized.""  I do however, have clothes I actually love wearing.  I think this is a perfectly acceptable thing to do to get yourself started.  
There are also, certainly, some more questionable purchases I've made in the name of, ""Minimalism.""  Feel free to judge them as you will.  
1.  I replaced my shitty desk that made me unhappy to look at, and which was massive with a tiny, tiny wooden desk that looks nice but secretly folds up and fits in my car easily.  I will no-longer spend another second breaking down my complicated bulky shit desk or worrying about the fact that the keyboard tray is held together with duct tape.  I find this valuable.  It is also Aesthetically minimalist, as it's so small it can no-longer function as a surface for bills / other paper to collect.  
2.  My mattress had needed replacing for a very long time.  I had a twin bed.  I am 6'3''.  I'm also diagnosed with about three sleep disorders.  Lastly, I was sentimentally attached to a bed I had owned since I was three.  I massively resented the sentimental attachment to something as large and bulky as a bed, since a lot of my goal is to remain fairly mobile.  I got rid of the mattress.  I gave the bed to my brother for my three year old niece to use as her first real bed.  I got a collapsible hammock frame, and a hammock. So, all and all, my sleep has improved going from a shit mattress to a no pressure point hammock, my room looks about 10x better, I was able to get rid of the sentimental attachment by passing it on within the family, and my brother was ecstatic having something with that much family history to pass on.  
   
I see your point about the mindset that could potentially influence asking this question, but I also feel like there are cases where, ironically, buying things for minimalism is legit."
1844,INFJ,observer,"Minimalism can also be used to fight depression- not by itself, but it's one of many tools.   You can remove things that remind you of trama and create an environment that is peaceful instead.  It also means you have less things to worry about when you're in the worst of it.      
      
That said, if you're making major life changes to prepare to commit suicide, please consider seeking help instead.  Being depressed is like being drunk.  You can't trust your own judgement because you can't quite remember what it's like not to be in such a dark place. If you can recognize that, there's a lot you can do to start climbing back out."
1845,INFJ,observer,"I'm not really interested in only essentials, personally.  Something can not be 100% essential and still add a lot of enjoyment to my life.   It's unfortunate that minimalism is kind of a misnomer for communicating the idea of intention ownership of things and intentional use of time.    "
1846,INFJ,observer,"I had a super similar experience recently when someone backed into the side of my car without leaving a note. It's really fascinating how ones relationships to objects changes when they begin to seriously analyze why each thing is in their life.  
""Love people, use things."" Y'know?"
1847,INFJ,observer,"This is going to sound mildly ironic. But, I'll tell you how I got over the, ""What if I need/want this later?"" moments.
You're going to throw out thousands of items before you're done with this.  Thousands and thousands of items ranging from small to big.  You will absolutely throw out at least 3-5 things you will wish you had later.  The problem is, you have absolutely no way of knowing which these will be.  
That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it anyways.  Almost everything you throw out can be replaced if you absolutely need to.  If it can't, you will honestly find that life goes on just fine anyways.  
   
Missing out on a few items you might want later is just the price you have to pay for permanently and completely changing your life for the better.  
    
Go with your gut instinct and make some impulsive choices.  You can do it! :)"
1848,INFJ,observer,"Okay, follow-up question.   Are you burning the board games?  Putting them in the trash?  Setting them in cement and then hurling them into the ocean from a speed boat late at night?    
      
No?     
      
Just because something isnt for you anymore doesn't mean someone else won't get some joy from it.  Donate them.    
      
Then, who do you have to feel guilty to?  You've done a kind thing and ideally brought some joy into the lives of people who couldn't have aquired the games new.     It's not as though they cease to exist.    
     
Are you feeling guilty to yourself?    
     
The only thing you have to feel guilty about is anchoring yourself down with things you've already decided don't add value to your life.    Let go.  :)"
1849,INTP,decider,"Sometimes there are medical studies that will pay you. Go to free food events. Always look for deals for food and cook. I never did the Top Ramen college ""diet"" but I recommend trying to eat healthy to not mess with your body.

&#x200B;

Since you mentioned fasting, I might also recommend starting the one-meal-a-day diet but to really make it work you need to plan out your meals well (not getting enough nutrients is setting yourself up for failure)."
1850,INTP,decider,"I think ISxP. You display Se since you said you are very aware of your surroundings and have a good memory of your surroundings (photographic/hearing/kinesthetic).

You also said that you would survive without hanging out on weekends but also have a preference to hang out with people. Many ESxPs would suffer way more from being alone.

I see some evidence for Fi which would support ISFP. You said you take things personally and have gut feelings about things. You try to hide your reactions to your emotions which could technically support Fi or Ti.

Some support for Ti is that you are able to easily find faults in things and find ways for people to improve and you have a hard time not getting into an argument.

So yeah as I said ISxP. Here's some guidelines to help you determine if you have Ti or Fi:

Some characteristics of Fi: You have a natural moral compass. You have a set of values that you live your life trying to adhere to. These values aren't necessarily logical but you don't care. Since you aren't easily swayed (sometimes you may act nicer to avoid conflict but that's okay), people find you authentic. You are also very aware of your emotions, even if it takes you a while to process them.

Some characteristics of Ti: You have a logical system that you are frequently ""fact-checking"" against. Your system isn't as resistant to change as a Fi user's moral compass. It's based on logic so if you find logic that proves you wrong, you are willing to update it. Since we are talking about ISTPs specifically (instead of INTPs), you may like using your logic to understand how physical things work and maybe even build them or take them apart. Think of someone who takes apart their lawnmower or builds their own computers. You are also somewhat unaware of your emotions and in fact don't really like emotions and don't really get why people get emotional. Emotions are dumb and get in the way and it's not as worth it to spend time on them.

If Fi resonates with you, you're an ISFP. If Ti, then you're are ISTP."
1851,INTP,decider," I see how that is symbolic. What does that have to do with Ni? Since you were able to draw a conclusion using your intuition?

Technically you should be somewhat strong in your 5th and 6th functions, which in your case is Fe and Ni. In a way, they're inversions of your normal Fi and Ne. It's just that you prefer not to use them as much.

Since I'm an INTP, I have Ne and Ni in the same positions as you. I feel like I can draw conclusions sometimes but I'm often way more indecisive using Ne. And that projection 5 to 10 years in the future and sticking with it that Ni dominants are said to do it hard for me."
1852,INTP,decider,Hmm I actually thought Se was stronger than Ne. You display a lot of hobbies that use Ti with the physical world so Se. ISTPs can understand how things work but it's usually grounded in reality in some way. Didn't see much abstract Ne topics.
1853,INTP,decider,"This one is a bit tough. I'm going to guess INTP.

You said to want to be balanced by not being too logical or too emotional but otherwise you display a clear preference for thinking and logic and a clear preference for not focusing on emotions. You also said you overthink a lot and have a lot of ideas which sounds like Ti + Ne.

You did mention that reflecting on the past is important but the present is what really matters. This sounds like a possible contrast of what you think is right vs what you do. As an INTP myself, I look for the ideal way to do certain things but if you look at my actual actions I don't end up following a bunch of them out of laziness, being satisfied with understanding, etc. INTPs tend to dwell on the past a lot (Si) and have a harder time focusing on the present. I get the feeling you're in a similar both.

Another INTP trait was your Fe explosion, where you notice that every now and then you get really emotional and explode. INTPs try to stay relatively calm but every now and then (could be once a year) they will just let it all out in a fury of anger and vengeance.

I saw some possible suggestions that you might be good with Se or Fi but I don't think you lead with either of these. You said you're bad at sports and clumsy and that people think your facial expression is cold or blank. That resting face of INTPs is pretty common and people with Se tend to appear more expressive and normal. You mentioned some values which might be Fi but it felt more like a detached rehash of your values than a strong attachment you your values."
1854,INTP,decider,"Yeah sorry about that. You said you consider yourself an ambivert so I wasn't sure if you were an extrovert or introvert.

Many INFPs come off as extraverts so that didn't help either lol."
1855,INTP,decider,"Agree that you should use cost of living calculators. It will tell you your net pay and give you an average to work on. That being said, you should try to estimate how much you yourself will likely spend. Major costs are usually rent, transportation, and student debt. Then you have groceries/eating out costs, bills like internet/utilities/phone, and miscellaneous costs like hanging out or shopping. Also moving can be expensive so if you like furniture and other stuff you can estimate that you'll spend more starting out."
1856,INTP,decider,"Didn't read your post but I wrote this a while back (Didn't change the ISFP/ISTP references):

Some characteristics of Fi: You have a natural moral compass. You have a set of values that you live your life trying to adhere to. These values aren't necessarily logical but you don't care. Since you aren't easily swayed (sometimes you may act nicer to avoid conflict but that's okay), people find you authentic.

1858,INTP,decider,"Yeah good luck! There really is a chance that I'm wrong lol.

I will say that I also have a similar perception regarding feelings. I model the way people act and can predict how they'll act quite frequently. I partially attribute it to the INTP pattern matching ability and that while our Fe is weak it still exists. And yeah there have been so many times when I think ""Man that will probably piss someone off or someone will probably call me out on that"" and then it happens...

I'd recommend talking to people you know are Fe dominants and see how they use Fe. (Or Fi if you think you might be an xxFP. It's harder to tell with xxFP though since it's more internal.)"

If you‚Äôre interested and in a place that it is legal, look into CBD oil with very low THC. As long as the THC is low enough, it will not get you high and the CBD creates a relaxing feeling. :)

So to solve this, I'd find the size of the bath towel ([https://www.overstock.com/guides/bath-sheets-vs-bath-towels](https://www.overstock.com/guides/bath-sheets-vs-bath-towels))

Assuming the side of  the towel we see is the 60 inch side, that is folded in half to give 30 inches. 

Now we measure the time it took for the camera to cover this 30 inches - 3.77 seconds

So I can assume the camera moves at 30 inches every 3.77 seconds

Next I found out how many of these 3.77 seconds were in this video - 15.81/3.77 = 4.1936.....

Then I multiplied that number by 30 to get a total of 125.8 inches or 10ft 5.8inches

If we did this with the 35 inch side, we'd get a total of 6ft 1.39inch which seemed too small.

2109,ENTJ,decider,"It could  be dangerous if it's ill defined, applied frivolously or without proper evidence. And in this climate of man hating, that's what I fear will happen. 

Beyond cruel words, my definition of emotional abuse would include depriving a partner of their needs, career sabotage, ruining a partner's credit rating, running up debts, driving the partner's friends and family away, or putting them in unsafe situations. There are destructive things an abuser can do to cause enormous amounts of stress that don't actually involve violence. 

For instance, I knew of a female whose husband would wake her up in the middle of the night on week nights and scream at her for hours, ""picking a fight"", so she would be too tired to function at work. He would also hide her keys (the keys weren't lost, he admitted to hiding them) so she couldn't drive to work in the morning. Periodically her blood pressure medication would go missing. There were other things he did to troll her, too many to mention here. He would mess with their dog to upset her too. She was middle aged. The husband was retired and a heavy drinker, often drunk and he probably had borderline personality disorder. It was a second marriage for both. He never once hit or touched her in an aggressive way so it didn't legally qualify as ""domestic violence"". She was so relieved when the divorce papers were finalized. 

If a crazed partner wants to make your life hell, they can. "
2110,ENTJ,decider,"Even if you have a legal right to get your belongings back and/or take them to your Dad's, what action would take against your Mom and Step Dad? Sue them? Report a theft to the police? Would that be the highest possible good you can conceive of? 

It may not be true that your stepfather hates you. His words were harsh and I'm sure it stung to hear he didn't want you there. But maybe he would be okay with you being there if you made efforts to earn his trust? Is it possible to improve the relationship you have with him? 

Even as adults we need our families. Unless you've been on the receiving end of true abuse, it isn't justifiable to burn bridges with parents. Even when you turn 18, you may not have the mean$ and life skills to move out and successfully live on your own. Likely you'll continue to need help from the adults in your life in your late teens. We live in complex societies and I don't know many 18 year olds who can manage well on their own. 

So yeah, make nice with your parents and try to maintain good relations with them as best you can. If you do that, the next 9 months will probably be less difficult than you fear. Take courage!

Call her manager immediately this is an outlandish breach of her duties as an agent.

when you hear a woman say ""i want a man whos kind, smart and funny"" they mean ON TOP of being physically attractive enough, they never mean ""kind smart and funny AND you dont have to be physically attractive AT all"""
2190,INTJ,observer,"it doesnt have to mbe morally justified, nor is it based in her contribution or any conception of ""deserving""

a marriage is like a legal partnership in the eyes of the law.  when you are married you each own 100% of the marital assets.   when you divorce you are each apportioned 50/50 in a community property state or some other portion in an equitable distribution state.  there is no moral issue here.  this is about legal joint ownership of all marital assets by the MARRIAGE.  the marriage is a legla union, a ""corporate person"" economically.  

marriage is not employment.  she was not the marriage's employee, she didnt own the marital assets because of her ""contribution"" to the marriage but because of the legal state of marriage and nothing else.  again, DURING the marriage she had 100% ownership of all the marital assets, and so did he.  by divorcing SHE LOSES HALF OF HER ASSETS TOO, she doesnt GAIN half of HIS assets

we can argue over whether it should be this way, and since only nine states are pure 50/50 community property states obviosuly other arrangements are possible

the moralizing of the arrangement is baseless and nuts.

when i was at the height of my attractivenes to men i spent hours crying in the mirror over my intrasexual beauty marker flaws.  my hips too square, my head too flat, my nose too big, clothes didnt fit me like they fit other girls on and on and on.  all the male attention in the world didnt alleviate my comparing myself to OTHER WOMEN and coming up short TO MYSELF

-  When you invade and die on a host's world, your bloodstain should be where you initiated the invasion, not where you died on the host's world. 

- Soldering Iron could get a buff, maybe a 50% damage buff and the estus cancelling effect should be  50% longer. I understand it isn't a ""serious"" weapon, but it can still have a use/niche. 

- Make titanite slabs farmable, or have the handmaiden sell an unlimited amount... Let's say 100k souls for a slab and 50k souls for a gem. 

- Increase rewards for invasions. If an invader defeats the host he/sheshould get 10% of the souls needed to level up, if the host kills the invader, then the host gets 50% of the souls. Same goes for RSS duels. I'm tired of getting just barely enough souls to buy a green blossom, let alone all the other stuff I've used after a duel. Autosummon invasions should get the soul values stated above and a randomly generated upgrade material. 

- A blue eye orb, please! 

- Maybe increase the values needed to rank up in the arena, please? I got two gold badges a day after the other, in perhaps less than 5 hours of playtime, that's pretty bad... 

Maybe it should be something like this: 

15 wins for stone; 
50 wins for bronze; 
150 wins for silver; 
500 wins for gold. 

- Add all boss rooms as arena maps!   

Can't think of more stuff, right now D;

*edit* 

- Armour defence values should not have a boost/penalty if the whole body isn't covered up! I like going bare chested and I'm not a big fan of using helmets either...  

- No upper level limit for invasions of any kind. But have it progressively increase in level, if hosts are not found at the same level as the player.

She might be telling the truth about her meds not keeping her awake, but it's not typical."
2297,ESTJ,decider,"They don't get that the distractions, and expectations, are different. Pressure to perform well, and knowing I'd be graded on every minute detail and get points marked off for mistakes, made it a lot scarier to study and do assignments than play a game with zero consequences beyond losing and having to start the game over."
2298,ESTJ,decider,"That's not normal in the USA, not for standard ADHD medication. Psychiatrists ask about what else you're on, because some meds interact with others. If they're demanding that you take a different medication outside their specialty, that's a red flag. Mine wanted to know what I was taking, but not taking anything else wasn't a problem.

And she should have asked about other symptoms in session. If you can pick a different doctor, consider doing that."
2299,ESTJ,decider,"ESTP does look more likely than ENTJ. Se-Ti vs Te-Ni. Se-Ti shares preference for external action with Te, and ENTJ has Se lower in the stack, so there are some similar behaviors produced by different motivations. I don't see high Ni here.

There's not a lot here to determine tertiary Fe vs. inferior Fi. Slightly more evidence of low-stack Fe than low-stack Fi, which fits. The first two functions are more important, especially at 19 when lower functions are weaker."

This. This is the worst part, people complaining about someone not doing good enough, but not giving any actionable advice, not even one or two specific suggestions to help with one part of the problem."
2301,ESTJ,decider,"I didn't like CBT for a lot of these reasons. There's an assumption, by many programs/practitioners, that any negative thoughts are wrong - when sometimes they're actually spot-on. Ideally, the first thing they do is see whether or not the negative thought is true, and then handle true and false ones differently. False thoughts need challenged, but true thoughts are pointing at a real problem that needs fixed differently. Sometimes you get a good therapist who does that. Sometimes you get one that handwaves any real complaints away as ""oops! negative thinking! that's a no-no!"", or plays a crappy semantics game when you use ""always"" colloquially to mean ""usually"" and they argue with you on the grounds that it's not literally always true. Just because I showed up early to one appointment doesn't mean I didn't have serious time management issues...

I had successful therapy, but about half of it was self-help, and none of it this round was CBT. It works for some people and some issues, done correctly. Too often it's done incorrectly or not the right solution in the first place."
2302,ESTJ,decider,"Then yes, ENTP is more likely."
2303,ESTJ,decider,"Weightlifting. I don't like running - results are slow and it's boring. It also doesn't really help me in day-to-day life because I already have no problem walking long distances or staying generally active without getting tired. Strength training makes me better able to carry heavy things and move even heavier things around. It's a more satisfying accomplishment since I'm small.

I sometimes walk instead of drive if it's a short distance and I don't have to bring a lot of stuff back with me. It feels less pointless than running even though otherwise it's not very different: it saves a little gas and completes an errand.

Got injured and can't work for a week, can't exercise much either so this is annoying. At least I'm clear to move around - some walking and light upper body exercise is okay. Better than nothing."
2304,ESTJ,decider,I usually like it. It's much easier for me to maintain a long conversation with a call than texts; one 15-minute chat vs. dozens of interruptions over a few hours.
2305,ESTJ,decider,"One thing at a time. Either pick a part of the apartment, or an overall task (like picking up and taking out the trash), do that, and maintain that until it doesn't take as much effort. Then add more, and more, until you're doing all of it. Ex. don't even concern yourself with whether or not the cupboards are neat, just make sure there's nothing expired or spilled in it and move on at first.

I still have trouble with ""invisible"" tasks like dusting and cleaning floorboards - ugh. If I'm ever rich I'm going to hire someone for those. Keeping everything straightened up and basically clean isn't hard anymore, though if I'm without meds too long I slip some on the neatness part."

2318,INFP,decider,"So if I'm reading this right, it sounds like you want him to be more motivated or to move forward? I wouldn't know the solution to your problem or his, as every situation and person is different, but hopefully I can help by sharing my own story. (Im a 9 and im pretty sure Im an sp) I personally had trouble during high school with homework, as I could never motivate myself to do it. My mom (a 1) was really bothered by this and struggled with what she could say/do to make me get things done, knowing I was stubborn and didn't like to be nagged. Heres a few points on what you could maybe do?

1. It is truly amazing what blossoms in someone when they are loved and accepted for who they are. She and other good people in my life, started loving me with my love language ( Mine being words of affirmation/quality time. Look it up if you've never heard of it, it's a life changer.) I, and my family and friends, are by no means perfect, and we do not always love each other the best. But we try, and my life is all the better.
2. I had to make some tough decisions for my life, and I made those all by myself. I don't think anyone could have told me or made me do it. But because of the people around me loving me and supporting me, I started to thrive. I also had to get to know myself in order to understand how I like to do things.
3. I was told truth, like how awesome I am, and how I deserve a good life. Eventually I started to believe it. It is crazy how we go through life, making often unconscious decisions about ourselves and the world (such as I don't deserve happiness or Im a failure).

I hope this wasn't too long, and it maybe gives you some ideas on what you can do as a supporter. Remember, you aren't responsible for someone else's choices. It's hard, but give yourself a break. Do your best to be there for them. It sounds cliche, but really the choice is up to them. Good luck!!"

2381,ISTJ,observer,"I have been playing a bit more, and I coming to realize that a lot of the characters don't feel that satisfying. Sure, the stuttering and weird mouse sensitivity makes it feel worse, but I genuinely think that the characters just don't feel as good compared to the last game.

Besides that, so far, I am enjoying Captain Deadbeard and Engineer in the zombies side. I normally am not a fan of sniper characters, but I played him a lot in the last game, and he still manages to feel satisfying. Unfortunately, his shotgun got nerfed hard, so that doesn't feel great. His anchor feels great and his barrel is a good emergency tool. Plus, the head hurtbox in this game seems generous compared to other games.

As for engineer, I played him a bit in the last game, but now, they reworked him with elements that I am quite familiar with. His turret allows me to pull some Torbjorn strats, and his concrete launcher functions like Junkrat's grenade launcher. Both of those I enjoyed quite a bit. His speed pad allows me to be a taxi character, and his sonic grenade is a good answer to the annoying night caps and sneaking chompers. And today, I just discovered that my turret reloads my gun. Now I can spam my weapon at choke points and get some kills, and prevent anyone else from approaching.

For the plant side, I am not sure. I like Citron. I wasn't that big of fan of him last game, if I remember correctly, but how they reworked him makes him more enjoyable for me. His shield is nice (I would not want that on a cd, since I think it is more useful if I can pull it out when I need it. I also like his laser for some quick pokes, but I disliked how the laser felt in the last game. I prefer the primary weapon he has right now.), and allows me to help the team quite a bit.

The other plant characters do not pop up that much. I probably should try Cactus a bit more, but the flying ability feels weird. Also, the mines are less emergency useful than the barrel. I do like Acorn, but getting randoms to work together is tricky.

As for the heroes I think I would enjoy but do not now because of changes: Kernel Corn (too weak), All-Star (Find it more difficult to support the team, and his weapon feels weak), Rose (I do like the speed boost, but the tracking is very weak, meaning that many shots miss. On top of that the damage is weak. The Goat ability is better, but I find it has some bugs. Overall too passive for my liking.).

And finally, disclaimer, I have not played the new characters too much, and I still need to play some of the other characters to see if I like them or not."

2413,ENTP,observer,"Granted. Since your first part of the wish was to have never found the monkey's paw, it grants that by wiping your memory and reverting it to pre-monkey's paw knowledge.

It was an item you were saving up for for quite a while, and now it's finally arrived. You get your money ready, pay the courier and sign the papers, and the package is all yours. Filled with pure joy you head back inside to open it up. You feel the box is a tad too light, but you don't pay too much attention to it. You finally open it up and peek inside. Instead of the item you wanted, there's instead a printed out image of Brian from Family Guy saying ""suck my nuts liberal""."

2420,ENTP,observer,"You will truly dominate NoFap when you decide you prefer to stare at a wall during the whole day instead of watching porn/faping.

If you don't reach that, then it will always come to excuses. It only takes 1 minute of weakness to start edging and around 5 to 30 on average to cum...do you think that a successful Fapstronaut manages to keep himself uncomfortable and not bored 24/7? I personally don't think so, even men with ""perfect"" lives (lets say an amazing girlfriend, money, friends, success, etc) go through hard times and find at least 1 minute of weakness and fap. 

I read a lot of comments of people saying ""get out of your house, find some new activities, take a cold shower, etc...and I stand by what they say, it is helpful and healthy advice, its just that its not there when we thrive but in the hardest moments. Dominate yourself and you will dominate your life."

2483,ENFP,observer,"Sure. It is very easy to make. You need cream horn or cannolli mold or you can make DIY version yourself. Cut puff pastry into stripes of 2 cm wide, spread with the rolling pin until they become twice in length. Wrap them around the molds (if your mold is large wrap two stripes) and let them bake for around 15 mins in 180-200 centigrade oven. After they cooled down a bit you can separate the molds.
For the filling I just used simple whipping cream with powdered sugar and vanilla. You can add strawberry pieces to the cream which becomes amazing or use creme pattisiere instead which I like more. And in the end spread sugar powder on top.let then stay in the fridge for 3-4 hours before serving."

2567,INTJ,observer,"despite having so many inconsistencies I love season 4, because we see winx becoming more mature. But started form season 5 we see they are becoming more and more childish. For me, started from season 5 winx kinda lots its common sense. I understand that creators wanted to appeal to a younger audience, however it would have been much better if they did not continue the storyline after season 4 and instead created a new series or a spin off for younger kids. (I am not talking about Netflix spin off)"

2569,INTJ,observer,"Sure. Okay, I think designers wanted to make fun of Bloom, Flora and Stella. Compared to their original outfits, those looked distasteful not even childish, just distasteful. Most people like Tecna's new enchantix but I honestly think that only Musa's new enchantix is more or less bearable. I do think that pinkinsh wings suit her better than yellow ones. It is also hard to look at Aishas new enchantix, I think it changed so much. Too much pink on everyone. Also, the transformation process copied from Sirenix and Tynix."

2574,INTJ,observer,"ah it's hard to choose, the first four seasons were really good, despite many inconsistencies. They had cool villans, interesting storylines, cool transformations and power upgrades that unfortunately started to degrade in following seasons.

To think anyone working at Gamestop is on a power trip is wild, most of us are extremely self aware that the business has been failing since we were hired.

Surprise surprise, a really creepy guy kept trying to grind up on one of the girls. She felt really uncomfortable and moved to the other side of the little huddle we were in. The guy seemed to take the hint and left...or so we thought. 15 minutes later, and my friend feels someone grinding up against her again. Same old creepy dude. 

What happened next was too crazy to process in real time. My high school buddy pulled the guy off the girl, and straight up just started kissing him. A sloppy wet kiss on the lips, tongue and everything. In what was the most surreal 3-5 seconds of my life, just as the old dude started to process what was happening, my buddy shouted ‚ÄúRUN!‚Äù In one quick motion, he pushed the guy backwards into a couple other people, grabbed the girls, and we bolted out of the club onto the street.

For those of you who haven‚Äôt been to 6th Street, there‚Äôs a section of the street that‚Äôs blocked off, and on each side of the street is a row of bars. There‚Äôs a huge crowd of people just walking in the middle of the street, hopping from bar to bar. As soon as we got out, we quickly blended into the crowd and headed straight for another bar. By far the gnarliest night of my college experience.

""Lift Off"" is so soothing, ""World's On Fire"" and ""Hold It Together"" keep resonating in my head, ""Brooding"" with its smooth transition to ""Promises I Can't Keep"" is just pure beauty, and ""Running From My Shadow"" with ""Ghosts"" are still my favorites. hats off for Mike Shinoda, he did amazing job, and I'm extremely proud of him!"

2640,INFP,decider,"I have to disagree, but personally I don't feel offended. this is your own opinion so it's okay, you have right to feel that way. to me, I don't think that Post-Traumatic is lacking anything, I don't compare it to LP discography. it is different album - of course it is. it's not Linkin Park's, it's Mike Shinoda's. it's his point of view, and his way to express himself - that's how I see it. the fact that Post-Traumatic is a little bit raw, a little less sleek album just fits the idea that it's in fact the record of Mike's fight with trauma, grieve and other feelings. like, you know - diaries usually aren't super-sleek, cause it's not the point of them. the point lies in sincere, raw feelings.

After 72h your body will be more likely to lose muscle density than fat, ketosis would help but even if u are in ketosis you'd still lose lean body mass. The best way is a short 48h fast to clear ur digestive system and/or hiit/weight/resistance training.

I am 5'7 and I had winter fats exactly like ur first pic (SW153, CW149, gaining muscle as well as cutting so still far from 135GW)

2691,ENTP,observer,"whether your body burns more fat or ur muscle in extended fasting period over 72h is still undetermined. No doctor or nutritionist should or can tell you that definitely, because each fasting on every individual is different, your biological gene is different, your eating habits is different, your medical history is different. for example OP and I are Asian females in 20s, our ethnicity and gene and fat cell distribution on our body is primarily different than a caucasian female.

So if you go back to my original reply, I said ' **likely** to decrease muscle density over fat'because growing up common asian cooking and diet are mostly carbs and then protein and then fibre which is carbs, least of all is fat. (stir fry dishes with rice, stew with rice etc.we don't eat fatty meat or put too much butter in dishes or sauce) 

So my point is, like me OP was new to low carb diet and our body are not used to consume fat, **especially look at her previous photo, her body figure suggested she was not obese and was within normal weight to begin with*

Thats why i concluded she is like me, *likely* to have decrease muscle density over fat in extended fasting period.

Because she couldn't understand a word of it"". I felt terrible and I said to myself I was going to learn English and speak it native-like so no one would ever humiliate me as she did. So I downloaded Duolingo and completed the first round in a year and a half. While doing this I used to listen only English music and write down the lyrics and then the Spanish translation, and try to sing along to master the accent. When I finished the first round on Duolingo I also started watching TV series and movies in English with subtitles. Then reading in English. I think when I was 16 I already sounded native-like but needed to expand my vocabulary and to work on grammar. Now I consider myself as fluent and I sound pretty much native most of the time. I didn't practice with anyone while learning since I've always been very perfectionist and I didn't want people to listen any mispronounciation or grammar mistake or anything, but since I'm 16-17 I've had to do it to improve my English. Well, that's my story haha, I guess I just love languages and I find learning languages through media fits perfectly with in introvertion."

No you are not.  It is not selfish to want a partner who fulfils you in ways that are important to you.  Sex and intimacy are important.  I have had a few long term relationships (44 F) and will never do a non BDSM relationship ever again.  Feels like something is missing.  Sex becomes a 'chore' when you aren't into it.  And then your partner will also feel unfulfilled.  I won't even do BDSM lite type relationships.  Yes you can find someone who will tick the important boxes.

Many pets are kept in too small a cages too, rats, guinea pigs, various pet bird species are chronically housed in too small a space.  Two wrongs dont' make a right, but I am using this to show that there isn't that much difference in actual enforcement.

IME of living in farm country and working on the odd dairy farm (I raised and trained horses myself) the vast majority of farmers are very good to their animals.  Most love animals.  But even if they didn't, healthy relaxed meat animals cost less to feed, less to vet, cause less damage to barns and fences and in general make a much greater profit."

The client (your pc) will adjust it's timer accordingly with every tick. This is why ##:00 rarely happens because it often syncs before that. When you press, your client returns some of the data to the server to verify that you haven't cheated. We owe the fact that a 0s flair exist to the existance of the 0s tick, when you return that data you get a 0s flair.

The first time freaked me out, I only did a few hairs on my ankle and then didn't try again for a while. But one time I decided to do my armpits and just pull through, and I did even though I bled a lot. But once the hair grows out, as you said, it's much thinner and it barely hurts at all! 

Sorry to say this, but the first time is probably going to be the most painful. Although if you then do it regularly and don't let the hair grow out too much, I wouldn't even the describe it as painful. For your first time though, maybe just trim the hair so it's not too long. There are also epillators with different settings and caps to make it less painful. I have one for example with a ""beginner's cap"" and a ""gentle cap"" and they pluck fewer hairs at a time. 

Other than that, I don't think there's much else I can say than to just pull through. If you keep going at it, you'll eventually feel sort of numb and it's not that bad. Also, I think after 7 years you'll maybe find the experience to be different. A lot of the pain also comes from the expectation and fear of the pain.

2824,ISFP,decider,"I'm 6'3 195lbs and I wear a medium for most pants/shorts, especially athletic wear because I don't want my pants to fall down at the gym. My waist is like 32-33"" so wearing a large would be too big, but I have a pretty lean build and most of my weight is in my chest, back, and legs. if you have more of an average build then it'd make sense to go L, but these models are probably all like 170-190lbs and very lean. 

also athletic pants usually have a fixed inseam across all sizes, so sizing up doesn't make them longer. or it's only an inch or two difference and I'd rather have pants that stay on at the gym than have pants that are long enough but also fall down."
2825,ISFP,decider,"I worked security at a pretty big building with huge parking lots. Used to be an airplane manufacturing plant I think and was converted into more of a storage facility for cars. I did patrol 2 shifts and then one shift inside watching cameras. During the patrol shifts, whoever was working had to get out of the car and scan these barcodes that were set up around the perimeter of the facility(but still inside our fence), just to ensure that the security guards were actually patrolling instead of just driving partially through the place. 

 So I'm doing a patrol, probably was around 1 - 3 AM, and I'm going around to one corner of the facility where you can see the other side of the street. It's dead empty outside except for this pickup truck parked on the other side of the street in a parking lot(front of the truck was facing towards my patrol car), and this guy was dancing around next to his truck. I think he was holding a bottle or some plastic bag or something. This dude was just dancing around and singing. I'm sure he noticed me, I was playing loud music from the car and it also had orange flashing patrol lights on, but I tried not to look at him when I got out and scanned that corner's barcode.  Anyway I had to do a patrol every hour, so I kept going by that same spot. And he was there for the entire night until I left(or maybe he was gone on my last patrol, I don't remember). Nothing crazy, but I thought it was weird. He was definitely on something"

2888,INFJ,observer,"I think your sentiment is so relatable. There's always the potential for incredible vulnerability in saying that you want to be in a relationship, but especially when you carry insecurities about your desirability or your readiness. As mothers, we often come to identify ourselves as nurturers and caretakers. Confessing our deeply held romantic needs can seem out of character and even humiliating. In that diminished space we can become prone to stuffing our feelings and taking whatever we can get sometimes, believing perhaps that we're ""too much"" or that what we want isn't even that important or attainable. I think that overcoming this mindset requires understanding how much you genuinely deserve having what it is you desire. It's about as simple as public speaking for the socially anxious, but your hopefulness will carry you through. You got this!"
2889,INFJ,observer,"I'm sorry that he decided to treat you this way. It's cruel, unfair and risk damaging your ability to love & trust long-term. Try not to go there and see him for who he's shown himself to be. People who operate this way tend to be poor assessors and extraordinary repressors of their own feelings. They can be expert at deception and avoidance of all sorts, but they're especially mastered at self-deception. Because they lack self-awareness, they're often led around quite unconsciously by emotion that they can't begin to control, process or articulate well enough that you can both solve whatever problem they think they're having. So they leave. It means their work is done and they can feel  relief in the moment. These people are rarely if ever great partners and often are simply seeking out men and women as a drug of choice. Once the hit wears off (ie, the ""feeling"" they're chasing), they leave. It sucks. I'm sorry."
2890,INFJ,observer,"People who do this, break up a relationship that's growing stable and healthily, are almost always poor long-term partners dealing with codependency. They're often spark chasers who use people as their drug of choice and when they can no longer get high off the person, they either create an escalation of interpersonal drama (cheating, stealing, lying to you) or they bail and find a new hit. 

I had a relationship with someone like this and even our breakup was loving and kind. His previous relationship was dangerous to the point of police involvement and he'd been cheated on. I loved him very much, but love myself more. Haven't talked to him since. Healthy relationships are primarily created,  not felt."
2891,INFJ,observer,"Mine's not the success story you're looking for, but it is a success story. I garnered the strength to finalize my divorce after years of separation when the last guy I gave my heart to told me that he wasn't ready. I got involved with him knowing that he was newly separated, working through an addiction and trying to get a stable co-parenting schedule off the ground with a woman who he had a dangerously toxic relationship with. 

After our breakup I had the opportunity to sit with all of my rationalizations for allowing myself to get so heavily involved with him given the complexity of his situation and I was finally able to recognize my own ambivalence about being in another long-term commitment. I'd had other commited relationships during my separation and had no doubts about my readiness until our breakup. So I ask, are you genuinely ready for and desiring of a commited relationship? What about this woman did or did not indicate that she was ready to give you what you desired long-term? Because so often the people we attract and then further decide to be in relationship with mirror our own struggles, even if unconsciously. 

She cares about you but may still never return to show up in the way you deserve. My ex was also upset during our breakup because I told him I didnt think we could stay in touch. The breakup itself was passionate and deeply intimate and exemplified how we treated each other. It's also the last we've spoken in months beyond social media likes. It's hard to not overanalyze but try to take this like any other breakup. Just another closed door yielding the way for what you truly hope for, with or without her."

There are hard sciences, soft sciences and pseudosciences, and temperament psychology ‚Äî in any of its better-established varieties, including the MBTI and the Big Five ‚Äî belongs (along with most of psychology) in the ""soft science"" category, and the MBTI can actually point to years of studies that basically put it on a par (psychometrically speaking) with the Big Five.

Anyone who's interested can read more about that ‚Äî and about several other issues often raised by people claiming to ""debunk"" the MBTI ‚Äî in this l-o-n-g PerC post:

[Another MBTI ""Debunking""](http://personalitycafe.com/myers-briggs-forum/283457-another-mbti-debunking.html#post8744961)

Among the sources cited in that PerC post is [a 2003 meta-review and large-sample study](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.4902&rep=rep1&type=pdf) that summed up the MBTI's relative standing in the personality type field this way:

>In addition to research focused on the application of the MBTI to solve applied assessment problems, a number of studies of its psychometric properties have also been performed (e.g., Harvey & Murry, 1994; Harvey, Murry, & Markham, 1994; Harvey, Murry, & Stamoulis, 1995; Johnson & Saunders, 1990; Sipps, Alexander, & Freidt, 1985; Thompson & Borrello, 1986, 1989; Tischler, 1994; Tzeng, Outcalt, Boyer, Ware, & Landis, 1984). Somewhat surprisingly, given the intensity of criticisms offered by its detractors (e.g., Pittenger, 1993), a review and meta-analysis of a large number of reliability and validity studies (Harvey, 1996) concluded that in terms of these traditional psychometric criteria, the MBTI performed quite well, being clearly on a par with results obtained using more well-accepted personality tests.

...and the authors went on to describe the results of their own 11,000-subject study, which they specifically noted were inconsistent with the notion that the MBTI was somehow of ""lower psychometric quality"" than Big Five (*aka* FFM) tests. They said:

>In sum, although the MBTI is very widely used in organizations, with literally millions of administrations being given annually (e.g., Moore, 1987; Suplee, 1991), the criticisms of it that have been offered by its vocal detractors (e.g., Pittenger, 1993) have led some psychologists to view it as being of lower psychometric quality in comparison to more recent tests based on the FFM (e.g., McCrae & Costa, 1987). In contrast, we find the findings reported above ‚Äî especially when viewed in the context of previous confirmatory factor analytic research on the MBTI, and meta-analytic reviews of MBTI reliability and validity studies (Harvey, 1996) ‚Äî to provide a very firm empirical foundation that can be used to justify the use of the MBTI as a personality assessment device in applied organizational settings.

McCrae and Costa are the leading Big Five psychologists, and authors of the NEO-PI-R, and after reviewing the MBTI's history and status (including performing their own psychometric analysis) back in 1990 ‚Äî using an earlier version of the MBTI (Form G) than the one being used today ‚Äî [they concluded](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/20447534_Reinterpreting_the_Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator_from_the_perspective_of_the_five-factor_model_of_personality) that the MBTI and the Big Five might each have things to teach the other, approvingly pointed to the MBTI's ""extensive empirical literature,"" and suggested that their fellow Big Five typologists could benefit by reviewing MBTI studies for additional insights into the four dimensions of personality that the two typologies essentially share, as well as ""valuable replications"" of Big Five studies.

2957,ISFJ,observer,Smh keeping Randle would have been better than signing JaVale McGee. 
2958,ISFJ,observer,Trubisky has this really bad habit of locking on to one receiver when he throws the ball. That definitely lead to that INT. The part that sucks is that this is going to hold him back. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever be an elite QB.
2959,INTJ,observer,Thanks for th reply! How did you arrive to this conclusion?
2960,INTJ,observer,"Ok so at a first glance, it would appear that INTJs trust more their gut rather than only logical facts. Of course Thinking comes and balances this. A guy on Quora said ‚Äúthe INTJ is not as rational as the INTP is. Ni is the reason why when INTJs think, they have sometimes this kind of flash, or ‚Äúaha moment‚Äù. Well, this happens to me. I mean i‚Äôm not always thinking, i have moments of deep thinking but that‚Äôs when i must solve a problem. Other than that, i jump into the situation to see how it evolves, and when someone says something I obsessively read that phrase in my mind to try to catch hidden meanings. But, when i must complete a task, i like to experiment in order to acquire knowledge on how to do it better. I think mostly in the pause time between a try and another"
2961,INTJ,observer,"Very physical, highly values past and has a developed culture on food, music and whatever has a ‚Äúcharming‚Äù aura behind it. He likes vintage things, and so on. Also he was a scout and was deeply concerned by the fact that many scout schools were controlled politically. Like i said, everything he says is a reference, and he is more interested in debating what‚Äôs proven and written more than what he/others got in their mind. He is definitely an extrovert in everything he does, although i can see him mistyped as an ISFJ."

2973,INFP,decider,I worked really hard to catch that egg.
2974,ENTP,observer,"It sounds like you and OP may be protecting yourselves from some perceived danger by not showing up when it more than likely doesn't exist. 

Not showing up takes the anxiety away; however, a new form of anxiety is introduced and based on a potentially more likely and actual threat (i.e., my friend my be mad at me and my friend may stop inviting me out).

I like how you say not all introverts are depressed and/or anxious. Infact, I suspect a lot of people on MBTI related forums believing they are MBTI introverts are actually MBTI extroverts that have social anxiety.  This is especially the case if someone is typed using a standard free MBTI assessment rather than one that assesses cognitive functions.  What would be important here is the standard test would match your responses to stereotype responses from percentages of E/I, S/N, T/F, and J/P rather than probing for why you chose the answers you did; the latter gets at cognitive function preferences (i.e., NeTi in my case).

Your cognitive functions, although may be related, don't dictate how much social interaction you crave or want to avoid.  For instance my cognitive function preferences map on to ENTP. Although I have an E in my MBTI code, I am an ambivert, socially; however, I do feel energized while around others that I can get into interesting discussions with, even if they are strangers. If I had social anxiety, I would probably test as INTP on inaccurate MBTI assessments because it's incorrectly looking at social interaction preferences rather than cognitive functions when measuring E and I.

No matter what your MBTI type is, I agree that mental health should be considered at any time one is making decisions they don't like and they often think ""I can't,"" despite wanting to and being aware of risks (i.e., potentially losing a friend). It sounds like it has both been painful and stressful for you and OP; this is not something you all should have to bear alone. I think you owe it to yourselves to be able to make decisions without social anxiety constraints."

2993,INTP,decider,"Peter and Stan are misogynists who rely almost entirely on shock value.  Sometimes they're funny but a little of it goes a very long way with me.

Also, I don't like shows that have one character that gets the butt of the jokes. I.E. Meg.  I don't mind a character that gets the short end of the stick by chance in various situations, that can be relatable and funny if done correctly, but when you're *singled out and bullied* it's just depressing. People like that exist too, and it's never funny to me. It's part of why so many people have emotional problems.

Bob's Burger's has awkward weird characters, (the Belchers themselves, and their friends/neighbors) but they don't just cruelly laugh at one person's expense and single them out in every episode, unless you're talking about actual enemies like Bob and Jimmy Pesto but that's a different dynamic entirely."

3003,INFP,decider,U most definitely should. Somehow became my favourite romance anime (granted I haven't watched many) and one of my favourite dramas
3004,INFP,decider,"This game became my favourite after 1 play through. It is very dialogue heavy but you'd be suprised at how much you'll be invested in it. I won't lie to u by saying certain parts of the story are stretched out and repetitive, but the narrative of persona 5 is amazing, both thematically and emotionally. 
As for gameplay, you have nothing to worry about. I could talk for ages about it the depth of its systems and how they connect with each other but u can probably find a good video for that. I have only 2 (And a half) complaints with it.
1) My main and only real complaint is mementos, the overarching dungeon of the entire game, expanding the further you progress. It's repetitive and dull with the same music and the same setting for almost hours but it's also something you have to take care of as it's something important to the plot later on... just grind through it. Tbh it's probably not as bad as your thinking
2) Its impossible to finish the game in 1 go... take that how you will. It's insanely long (roughly 100 hours) and it has even more confidants, quests and personas to unlock that you probably couldn't or didn't have time for the first time (story progresses over 1 year so time is limited)
3) This is the half I was talking about. The difficulty is pretty intense at times. I'm not really the strategic type but the game rewards having a well versed arsenal of personas and creatively using them. Around the 3rd dungeon is when they start having enemies that are resistant to multiple things and may have no weaknesses which makes them hard to defeat. But if u are the strategic type it probably won't phase you (unless you go hard mode)
But yeah in conclusion...
Go buy it"

3023,INFP,decider,Its really terrifying to know that while they are the minority there are still creepy sassing and obsessed fans who have the resources to do crazy things.

When we become infatuated with anyone, especially celebrities, we often have expectations for our ‚Äúideal partner‚Äù that are set a little to high and are unrealistic.

On the sexualization topic, it is hard to ignore something when its omnipresent. They must be very strong to put up with everything thats projected onto them and its extremely admirable i know i would crumble under all of that "
3028,INFP,decider,"I really really wanted to touch on disassociation/coping mechanisms in this post but i was afraid of offending or crossing the line with those who have personal experience with those things. I believe it is more common than not, and it may be very hard for some to separate music from the artist or fantasy from reality (which is why i have been putting an emphasis on younger folk). Even if the industry is focused on marketing fantasy i just hope that bts arent placed in uncomfortable situations too often, especially regarding sasaengs and the like "

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the learner decks, but from my experience they just kinda sit around because you're not able to use them in tournaments. To me, they really aren't worth the extra money for the starter deck.

Ideally, you should never be in a situation where you need to retreat- However, plans don't always work out, and it's a great way to pull an ally who has fallen out of the danger zone, and possibly into a clerics range of *Breath of Life* if the worst happens.  


So, me and my party where fighting some serpentfolk in the Emerald Spire when we managed to kill their boss. Unfortunately, their was a political schism and one of the Serpentfolk vying for control had managed to dominate one of our NPC's earlier in the dungeon... And none of us caught on. At first, our dominated pc was commanded to lay low, and pretend nothing was abnormal. Failed save. After defeating the ""boss"", our pc was commanded to attack us- Another failed save.  


After some panicked discussion, our witch used wall of ice to create some tactical cover, while our rouge started lockpicking a door to get us a new exit, as our entrance was occupied by summoned monsters, courtesy of the Serpentfolk behind the domination.  


However, I was able to use *Cut your Losses* to... retreat with the boss's dead corpse in tow, hiding in an adjacent room: No use letting all that loot get lost.

3064,INTP,decider,"It all started when I followed a QR code I found in the dumpster behind an abandoned gamestop under the full moon. It lead me to Dragalia Lost's App page... But something was different. off.

Dragalia Lost.Exe

On a whim I downloaded it. The Loading Screens were pitch black, and sometimes the characters heads tilted just a hair farther than normal- It was unnerving, but my first 10-pull netted me Wedding Ellie, Xander AND Long Long, so I didn't want to delete it. But... Still, playing my dailies on the reset always made me nervous. Jumpy- Tree branches would scrape against my window... Footsteps outside my door would be my imagination- The Fafnir's... bled? So red- For some reason when I try and screenshot it, my phone crashes. Nobody believes me. I tried taking a photo of my screen- The game suddenly loaded Wedding Aoi, but with cursed red eyes, telling me she would find me. I... Don't understand- I didn't pull her- I guess it's part of her story?

I left feedback. ""My game is bugged, and loading scenes I shouldn't access. Models are corrupted.""

They sent me 150 Wyrmite, telling me they would investigate further. I took a break- Was I... Sweating? Nervous? In a sudden panic, I decide enough is enough. I delete the app. A summer banner had came out in Feh- I hadn't played Feh for a long time. And yet, after the... Freaky incidents plaguing my life, I could use a distraction.

I open the game. Was someone..? I go to the window- Nobody is outside. But somebody was outside- I can see it, just barely along the sidewalk. Footsteps? I go to open the windo for a better look, and am distracted by my phone- Chills go down my spine as I listen to the sweet, innocent tune.

It's Dragalia lost- I don't understand, I deleted the game- And as I grab my phone, I drop it in horror. The loading screens had always been badly corrupted, but it always felt silly, if off-putting. And as I stared at the blood shot eyes and the familiar characters, hanging from thin ropes, I knew this corruption was not a silly error.

It was intentional- Menacing. It had to be- There was no other explanation. I pickup my phone it's moist I drop it my hands are red the screen isleaking it's leaking red and I hEaR fOOTspeps FoTStTepS Is thIs BL0d It is Warm sO WaRm I OPen The DOor And finD a KnIfe A GiFT frOm The DEV TeaM I PulLed a KNife Unit I aM the KNifE UnIT-

All is red now, as I slowly slip into a happy sleep. With my last strength and sanity, I go to pull one last time. I spend the 150 Wyrmite the Dev team had given me- And what unit would I get..?

I am greeted by myself on the other side of the screen, the knife buried in the chibi's model a perfect mirror of the wound I inflicted on myself... My battery is... So... Low.

Gains All Knowledge, Spellcraft and Linguistics as Class skills and gets bonuses to the DC of anything ""Monk Related"" (Such as a regular stunning fist, or Monk style feats) and Spells cast via the Psychic Discipline if he passes a Knowledge check to identify his enemy. At high, end game levels can learn Up to third level spells Via Psychic Discipline, can cast those spells through his ""Status"" tag, use Ki to get bonuses in Psychic Duels & on INT checks, Maintain ""tags"" equal to his INT modifier, and at level 20 he becomes Immune to mind effecting effects, Stops aging and can burn Ki to make a status tag permanent (Until the creature dies, doesn't count against his limit of tags)

I can say that this specific build Is possibly one of the most fun builds I have played. Riding a Huge Sized Dire Bat is fun enough, but it's even funner squishing the mount into places it shouldn't be. One of my Favorite Party Tricks involves carrying a Basic Treasure Chest on your mount.   


To set up an ambush, take the Treasure Chest off, and squeeze into the treasure chest (With the compression ability, a Huge sized creature can fit in if they can pass a DC 30 Escape Artist check: An animal companion can hit this with Skill Focus, slick barding, ext)  


Then, when a patrolling guard, Thief or Adventurer notices a chest somewhere odd, naturally they investigate. Little do they realize they are about to get a face full of Exploding Dire Bat!  


Anyway, I *Highly* recommend squishy Mammoth Riders. Great fun, would play again."

3071,INTP,decider,"One of my favorite go-to silly feats is Cut your Losses ([https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/cut-your-losses/](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/cut-your-losses/))Though, it probably isn't the best for an Archer. It's secret power is when you kill a boss, but due to Adds, environmental hazards, or time constraints you might have to leave the boss without looting him- With Cut your Losses, never leave a Boss behind! Just scoop him up while you run away!

It's one of my groups new favorites. Monks can easily get pretty good acrobatics checks to jump, and if you cut the DC's for jumping vertically down to something more reasonable... Your Monk can go practically anywhere they want.

Just think! The Bad guys have you cornered. They grin- After all, an Archer is ""dead"" the moment they are cornered in melee. But, to their surprise, you anime jump on to a distant wall 30 feet high, and continue shooting them as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.

3072,INTP,decider,"Perhaps this Half-Orc, upon converting to Desna, has gained a deep desire to travel the world. Maybe Steve has heard about the wider world- Before he gave no heed to tales of lush prairies, sparkling beaches and lush jungles, but by Desna's grace he yearns to see these sights for himself.  


But, he will stay with the party. Travel can wait until depts are paid, and working with Adventurers tend to lead one to strange and unusual places anyway. So Steve stays, occasionally asking questions about distant lands.  


""Does the crashing wave really sparkle under the sunset sky?""  
""I heard that you can see the Cynosure (Desna's realm) from the highest peaks- Think we try sometime?""  
""I heard about these dwarfs using fresh magma to create the finest glass known. Think it's true?""  
""That old lady said the finest flowers can be found in the First World. Let's go sometime!""  


However, despite all his hints, plot demands the party continue doing whatever they are doing- And if the Party tries to follow Steve's requests, he talks them down. ""Ah, not right now- We have to save those Orphans!... Then maybe we can find some souvenirs for the kids."" Maybe you can have brief ""Vacations"" in between plot elements, where the party does follow Steve's requests.  


And then Steve get's into a bad spot. How much of it is railroaded or engineered is up to you, but Steve is dying. It's a little to late for healing magic, and he's at his last breath. Then he can ask if he was a good Half Orc. Was he redeemed? Was he helpful? As fun as traveling was... He only wanted to see the party happy. He has one final trip he wants to make- He wants to see the boneyard, and ask Pharisma himself:

I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by your last question. Can you clarify? "
3088,ISFJ,observer,"This made me so sad to read :(

My mom has BPD and I spent ten years of my young teenage/adult life trying to help her. Trying to convince her people DONT hate her. That if she was just nice and open with people that she could maintain friendships, get along with her family, and not always feel like an outcast. She never got it, she instead just lashed out at me for not supporting her mood shifts and constant new opinions on her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. I was ‚Äúminimizing‚Äù the situation for her in trying to help her.

This sentence you wrote really struck a cord: 
‚ÄúI worry I‚Äôll have children just so there is someone else to give me love‚Äù. I believe my mom did this sadly. When I was around 14 I remember her coming into my room and crying stating ‚Äúall my kids do is take take take and give nothing in return‚Äù (we were ages 14, 12, and 9 at the time). I felt guilty for being alive, but then remembered she choose to have kids; it was all very confusing. I think she was happy when we were small (all under age 10). Her emotional outbursts were minimal (unless I was oblivious) but I don‚Äôt remember. I think she was content during those years bc she finally felt like she had a clear identity: she was mom of three small children/babies who needed her and provided unconditional love to her. We chose her over others (natural parental attachment) and this made her feel special. Once we grew up and started to have our own opinions on the world, become independent....she struggled with this greatly. This is when things got really bad for me. 

If it makes you feel any better, none of us have BPD. However I have severe anxiety and was depressed and suicidal for a while due to her. Your awareness of your flaws (everyone has flaws) and how you interact with others is huge. She never took responsibility for anything and said it was everyone else‚Äôs fault. 


You articulating FP.....wow. My mom used to use that phrase verbatim to refer to this friend she idolized. But as with every friendship, she loved them one moment and then was skeptical/mistrusting of them the next. She can‚Äôt maintain friendships. 

Thank you for giving me a glimpse of what goes on in the head of someone with BPD. It makes me so sad to think how my mom struggles internally, but never articulated. I had to break off contact with her for my own health and sanity a couple years ago...and she hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since. "
3089,ISFJ,observer,"My mother has BPD and knowing what I know about it, open relationships sound like a DISASTER for them. I suppose it‚Äôs not all one-size-fits-all, but I know that people with BPD really struggle with abandonment issues and self confidence/worth/identity. I personally feel like it would be really hard for someone with BPD to accept that their partner was seeing other people and not take that personally. 

But who knows! Only you ultimately can determine if it‚Äôs right for you. It‚Äôs not right for a lot of people, regardless of mental health issues. So don‚Äôt pressure yourself to be all for it if it doesn‚Äôt feel right."
3090,ISFJ,observer,"YES!! Omg nipple orgasms are so fantastic. Last weekend my Dom kept going for like at least 20-30 minutes and I kept having continuous waves of orgasms, they just keep intensifying. I melt into such a puddle of submission with nipple orgasms....in a way I don‚Äôt with other play. I love it "
3091,ISFJ,observer,"Fetlife can be an intimidating place for sure...it takes a couple months to feel like you successfully know how to navigate. For instance I joined in July and I just now feel like I know how to interact with those I want, avoid the creeps, and genuinely find good people. 

Some suggestions:
- don‚Äôt be afraid to chat with people before meeting them. Getting to know a little bit about them and their vanilla interests (as well as kink interests) helps to see if you guys will match up 
- use Kik (an alternate messaging app that makes it easier to communicate) with them when you feel comfortable and share pictures of each other, espec face, to see if there is physical attraction 
- meet up in a public place to get to know them 

Once you‚Äôve found someone you like:
- don‚Äôt let them take control of you right away. They aren‚Äôt your master UNTIL YOU ASK THEM TO BE. Many dominants on Fet simply don‚Äôt understand that. They have no power over you until you choose to give yourself over. This does not mean you are any less submissive, or of a kitten etc. 
- take your time and ease into things so you feel more comfortable and don‚Äôt feel taken advantage of. 

Be gentle with yourself and ease into it at a pace that‚Äôs comfortable for you. The right master will understand this and respect it. 

Good luck!! Xx"
3092,ISFJ,observer,"Hey, it‚Äôs okay to feel that way. I [25F] felt that way for a long long time, struggling with my severe social anxiety and depression after years of emotional abuse from my uBPD mom. My mom was highly functioning, intelligent and in her ‚Äúgood‚Äù moments wanted us kids to go to excellent universities and have great careers. I always wanted to be a physician. But the mental issues became too much, I couldn‚Äôt even function at my college. I‚Äôd have panic attacks and meltdowns that interfered with my grades, my ability to approach professors for help. Not only did I have to deal with my mother beating me down to a pulp for so many years, but also I felt like shit about myself. I wanted to just disintegrate into nothing. I felt like a burden, unlovable, ugly, stupid. No one liked me, I was weird, looked mean. These are all things **she** engrained in my head. 

I‚Äôd look around me and think ‚Äúomg everyone has it so fucking easy. Their parents are just supportive, while I have a psychopath mother to deal with on top of my insanely difficult studies and a father who doesn‚Äôt speak to me‚Äù (my mom actually alienated me away from him bc claiming he was evil, and my dad in hindsight couldn‚Äôt deal with her BPD enough to save me from her. They were divorced since I was 4). 

I used to have a lot of built up anger too. And in some ways I am still bitter that I couldn‚Äôt have focused on myself enough as a teenager and young adult that I could have pursued the career of my dreams. But I‚Äôve really just let go and focused on these things instead: 
‚ÄîStopped talking with my mom (NC 3 years now....which is **crazy** to think about) 
‚ÄîGot on an SSRI
‚ÄîFound an amazing therapist
‚ÄîReconnected with my dad (who I love to death and who I have come to realize is exactly like me). 
‚Äîfound the amazing power of exercise, healthy food and meditation 
‚Äîfocused on being the best person I could be 

All these things helped me feel WHOLE. I really did some self reflection about what I wanted in life, and now am on a great career path that is just as good, if not better, than a physician. 

You‚Äôll get past it, but you really just have to *let it go*. You can‚Äôt change the past and you can‚Äôt change the experience you had. Accept it and recognize that you have now have immense awareness of right and wrong after having to deal with a BPD individual. There are strengths that you got from that experience. You made it through. "
3093,ISFJ,observer,"Hi there, 

Ugh I [25F] know how it feels. I‚Äôve been NC with my uBPD mom for three years now, and actually it was her who eventually decided to ‚Äúdisown‚Äù me bc I had left her with **no choice** (sigh, the drama of the BPD). This was after years of me saying I had had enough, I just couldn‚Äôt take the emotional roller coaster anymore. I had no idea how to tell her that but more so STICK to that and not let her creep back in, or let my guilt in wondering if she is okay get the best of me. 

I like you was her best friend, her therapist, her everything. While she shat on me for not ‚Äúappreciating‚Äù her enough (somehow), being a selfish and narcissistic asshole, being not compassionate and an **ugly** person (yes she actually spent like two full minutes one time screaming that I was ugly, like to my core). She‚Äôd say things to me like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your kicking dog‚Äù, and screaming over and over ‚ÄúI‚Äôm human, my feelings matter‚Äù 

Anyways...she had given me this ultimatum that I was not to speak to her family members (my aunt and grandmother) bc my mom deemed the people as ‚Äúevil‚Äù for some things they may or may not have done when she was a child. At this point, I don‚Äôt even care if anything did happen to her. And I never knew what to believe either bc she would lie straight to my face about things I has supposedly ‚Äúdone‚Äù to her. She found out (by looking at my phone records) that I was in contact with them and decided that I was a toxic person for doing that. I had to speak to my family, who I loved very much, in hiding for many years as not to piss my mom off. 

She sent me this email, titled ‚Äúindependence‚Äù when I was 22: 

*I am hurt that you would want to have a relationship with ‚Äî- since she committed assault and battery against me by punching me in the face 3 years ago; at the same time, with her parents, she also verbally abused me in front of your brothers for 20 minutes at my uncle's funeral after-party, including screaming such vile statements such as ""everyone cannot wait to see you in a casket."" That incident, together with her parents'--my sister and her husband-- assault on my brother the same day (because we both gave a 3 minute speech about our uncle/ my godfather), their acting as witness against me in court proceedings before that, and their brutal¬†treatment of my brother's family, has¬†led me to have no contact with them. ¬†

More than that, though, I am tired of your belittling statements and your need to text ‚Äî-[my best friend] with a seeming play by play of most of our encounters while we are together. In light of my life-long devotion to you, your lack of respect for me makes me very sad. ¬†

Lastly, because of your age and recent comments about your acquaintances paying their own bills I think that it is best for you to be financially independent. I have contacted Verizon and authorized you to take your phone number and start a new personal account for yourself. You have three weeks to do that.

Mom*



After that message I knew‚Äîthat‚Äôs it. I knew it was out of my hands. Her disowning me, as she had threatened for like the past year, was inevitable. 

She said nothing to me until three months later when I got this follow up email titled ‚Äútruth‚Äù  

*Dear ‚Äî,

I hope you are doing well.¬†I am writing to ask you to please not repeat lies that my sister tells you about me, e.g., that I had an affair when married to your father. Spreading my sister's rumor is slander because it is a false statement.

Interestingly enough though, my mother has several affairs that she told me about while she was married to Joe: two¬†sexual affairs with co-workers at Tek Coating And a sexual affair with Gaile Mooradian's husband, Jack Mooradian. I think you know Gail--she is Nana's first cousin and my godmother. Gail is the one whose daughter Cindy was killed in the car accident. Cindy's death came a bit BEFORE my mother's affair with Jack, surely while Gail was in a state of depression.¬†When my mother was married to my Dad he shoved her in our kitchen when I was 12 because she was (at least) giving Joe Sacoco free cartons of cigarettes from my father's business (she left my dad for Joe).

Certain types of people project onto others what they themselves have done. It seems that that is the case here. If you have shared Dianne's lie with anyone else please¬†straighten out facts from fiction with your companions, friends, and others who now may have a false impression. ¬†

I remain your proud parent who devoted 22+ years to helping you, ¬†and your brothers, in every conceivable way, to lead a prosperous life. ¬†

3096,INTJ,observer,"Answer: My assessment of the situation is as follows: She was going through a rather disturbing time in reference to mental health issues and possibly drug abuse as a result. 

After looking through her videos I noticed a disturbing amount of sudden weight loss and difference in presentation. I posted it [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/5TOdJmN). 

I think that because I do not know her personally, it is obviously not my place to diagnose her, but her facial expressions are of a quality that remind me of people I‚Äôve known to have schizophrenia and type II bipolar disorder. She could be going through a manic or schizophrenic episode, which are commonly first triggered in one‚Äôs late adolescence and young adulthood. 

This would explain why she was clearly on drugs or extremely manic in earlier videos, unable to speak coherently to her audience and repeating herself. If she is abusing drugs, it would reference her immensely sudden 30+ pound weight loss. It also fits extremely well into the idea of an episode of mania, as previously mentioned, where the sufferers usually engage in reckless behaviour, including drug abuse and disappearances. 

I think that what her boyfriend said about being in a professional setting in order to receive help is plausible, actually, and there is no evidence to support the hypothesis he is kidnapping her or something. In fact, it‚Äôs probably just speculation triggered by all the other events going on in the world right now. The fact is: she‚Äôs in the UK and the laws are very different from America, where the missing persons report would have been handled differently. 

It is likely she is simply receiving a notable amount of treatment for her mental health and possibly drug abuse issues. Don‚Äôt make mountains out of molehills. This happens all the time with sufferers of debilitating mental illnesses."
3097,INTJ,observer,"More like ""allowed to kill the fetus but not ruin a conscious human life by causing birth defects."""
3098,INTJ,observer,"That‚Äôs what is very intriguing to me. I don‚Äôt know the exact protocols of the UK but considering how thorough the investigation would be... there was obviously a level of impulsivity in the situation. If she were to go for treatment, you would assume she would tell people. That is why I think she may have a serious mental disorder as well. People with schizophrenia are specifically apprehensive to speaking to police and people of authority for their fears. That‚Äôs just one possible explanation, however.

I think there are two possible explanations for his behaviour:
1. He is genuinely trying to shut down the situation and is replying to people in order to ensure he doesn‚Äôt look like he‚Äôs avoiding questions. People are going into it with a fixed mindset (that he is kidnapping her or something) so they are seeing it differently.
2. He genuinely has taken part in whatever has happened to her, whether it is by her own doing or his, and that‚Äôs why he is acting suspicious. 
3. This is all a hoax lol (least likely but it‚Äôs odd enough to consider that I had to post it. Edit: plus, then the police couldn‚Äôt have been involved at all)

My only problem with that is: anyone with a reasonable amount of rationality would realise that if she doesn‚Äôt come back, it makes him look like a liar. If he‚Äôs a liar, everyone would target him and his reputation would be ruined, as it would confirm the suspicion that he isn‚Äôt being truthful. If she does come back and doesn‚Äôt explain what happened, then it‚Äôs still up for interpretation forever, and it‚Äôs likely that she just doesn‚Äôt want to tell the world dark aspects of her life. 

Let me know what you think."
3099,INTJ,observer,"I agree with your assessment completely. This is logically incongruent and I am bothered by it. I wonder if the ""professional"" help she is receiving is truly professional, or she is elsewhere attempting to receive a treatment if that is still the case. I doubt she is in a formal rehabilitation centre if no additional information is provided from a facility. 

Regardless, in any case whatsoever the authorities should investigate every individual who is in a close relationship with the missing person. If he isn't investigated there is something seriously biased in this situation."
3100,INTJ,observer,"People are mean to me because I'm not afraid to be completely honest about myself. I have a healthy amount of self-esteem and refuse to cut myself down a few levels for other people. 

This makes them uncomfortable, because they're used to people in my generation, and in general, having depression, low self-esteem, being insecure, and downplaying every aspect of their existence. They also expect people to lie to them so they can feel better about their own lives. 

As a result, people might get offended or think I'm arrogant by comparison, even though, in fact, I'm very aware of my current limitations and faults. I simply choose not to talk about them to other people unless someone were to ask me. 

I know who I am and what I want to be, and no one's opinion affects that for a notable amount of time."

But I think these cases are connected by counterfeit toxic THC cartridges."
3130,ENFJ,decider,"This is what happenes with any drug that works on the reward system.
You are getting your dopamine receptors saturated by the constant hits.
So the brain,in order to adjust will regulate by controlling or even stop the dopamine factory .(Meth is infamously known for that.and a significant amount of the damage inflicted upon the reward system is irreversible.they will litteraly never be happy again.)

Of course,healthy people who draw pleasure from multiple sources (achievements/reliantionships/food...) Don't put all their eggs in the same basket.

But desperate drug addicts who have nothing else but the bottle,the weed etc are very susceptible to this.

You just want to eat fast and finish the meal to calm the hunger and go back to what you really want to do : Juuling .

The brain is an idiot.You train him like a monkey he fucks you over with monkey behavior."
3131,ENFJ,decider,"You will be far better off the one cig a day,
Indeed the juul is much much more potent then cigs .
Even if you only vaped half a pod a day that would still be at least 5 times more nicotine then that one cig.
Dont create new associations and habbits to feed the addiction.

Down the road you could get in an anxiety trap going back from juul to cig to cig to juul.
Wasting money and health.

I got to say though man,you might be inflicting some sort of subconscious torture to yourself always waiting for that one cig.

Try the Allen Carr book.
There is chapters about that ""1 cig"""

3134,ENFJ,decider,"No that's a lie.
There is no universal consensus amongst the scientific community.it is torn apart.
Some countries have come to a concensus,like the UK,but they don't represent the whole scientific world.

Lots of doctors believe it is indeed a harm reduction tool,
Lots of doctor's think its worse then cigarettes because the nicotine concentration is so high that it could become cytotoxic.
They would rather fight something they know then something where all bets are on.

Nobody can affirm any thing,the levels of nicotine available are unheard of.

Vapers who smoked for decades say the juul is way more potent then the greasiest rolled up cig ever.
They can't switch back to cigs caus they feel like air ! 

Some people who smoked 10cigs a week are now drinking 1 pod a day.And are now REALLY addicted to nicotine .
Are They better off with this crippling addiction now ?

How many people have said ""I feel better but im sooo much more addicted ""

You can argue yes you can argue no.

Its not all about lung cancer when you want to speak harm reduction.
The long term cost of an early life addiction in many cases ends up having heavier concequences then a 71years old chainsmoker dying from tobacco related disease.

A lot of kids got addicted to the juul even though they would have never smoked a cigarette had vaping never existed.

One can argue that's worse.

There is no consensus what so ever.So don't claim that shit randomly and then tell others to educate themselves.

We all need a lot more time and education before getting to a consensus."

Its addiction.
Get over it.
You don't want to juul anymore.
NOTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT.
You are not going to magically wake up either not wanting to juul or wanting to juul without the associated guilt.
Its not going to happen.
EVER.

So do yourself a favour and just move on."

Because a lifetime vaper (which most of us will be because lets be real.If you couldn't quit cigs that are a known killer ,how will you quit something that gives you way more nicotine and that is in your hand way more then a cig ),is a potential cig customer.
No matter what.

If shit hits the fan,rolling a plant in paper will be more valuable then electronic gadgets you have to plug and maintain.

And in wealthy occidental cultures cigs were slowly dying.
Now nicotine is stronger then ever.

I‚Äôm in a somewhat similar situations... during the last 12 months or so I‚Äôve been doing different drugs but after I did lsd for the first time in July my mindset has started to change... i am now off almost everything (including alcohol) except for weed which I also want to give up... I spent a lot of time on self reflection and analysing my behaviour / thinking and came to some solid conclusions. I did trip again for second time after that to really let those conclusions sink in. 

Most importantly I realise that I don‚Äôt love and accept myself. Because of that I am always hard on myself and burn myself out from my perfectionism. Because I don‚Äôt love myself I am not really capable of loving others as I can be hard on them too. 

This is my motto now - ‚ÄúLove yourself and love others‚Äù. I‚Äôve been meditating daily for over 3 months now, got more into Buddhism and just started to try to be more like myself in as many situations as I can. Most importantly be kind to myself and others. It‚Äôs not always easy, I am still judging myself for a lot of things but at least I‚Äôve become more mindful of that

All the best to you on your beautiful journey ! Sometimes I‚Äôm wondering if LSD was a mistake... I think not.

So, rather than comment in a way that brings out the best in a person, they comment in ways specifically intended to rile someone up and bring out the worst in them. They are generally unaware of the dangers of such behavior to our collective, and are also unable to notice just how amazing that particular character flaw can be."
3249,INFJ,observer,"I've seen a lot of people burn themselves because they don't do the proper research and take them to fix their life problems.

I took them, and still take them, to do exactly what you warned against... to fix my life problems. And... you know what? It's worked better than anything else. I am the happiest I've ever been in my entire life. I'm connecting more deeply with people. The quality of my work has improved by exponentially, and... now that the emotional work is done... LSD is helping me to repattern my neurology while simultaneously opening up flexibility within my body, which I've never had before.

The thing is, when it comes to using psychedelics to fix life problems... they're not for amateurs. Most will need a therapeutic guide."
3250,INFJ,observer,"I concur.

Have a friend who's terrified of trying psychs. Doesn't want a ""bad trip"". What he doesn't realize is that her waking life IS a bad trip. The psych will just point that out a bit more loudly and then say: ""Um... DO something about it."" :P"

3260,INTP,decider,"HH was born during a time when fansubs were pretty much dying. New shows were subbed weeks after release, most sites had lackluster interfaces and didn't give a crap about the content they were putting out.

HH changed all that.

But as a wise man once said, every journey must come to an end - and unfortunately, it ain't the happy kind this time. There's plenty of options out there now. Fansubs are faster than ever. Streaming sites are better than ever. There's no longer a real need for HH. We've done our part. Now it's up to the rest of you to carry the torch.

Thank you for visiting and supporting us over the years. It's been a wild ride. And you will all be sorely missed.

I have spoken Japanese my entire life. It is one of my mother tongues. I saw the character for thousands of times. I did not connect it to mindfulness.

I may get a tattoo of this character, haha.

I wondered what character would embody ‚Äúmindfulness.‚Äù 

Zen (ÂñÑ) does not cut it. The character means ‚Äúgoodness.‚Äù The Buddhist connotation is esoteric.

Ima (‰ªä) sounded common. Genzai (ÁèæÂú®) has two characters.

Note that nen (Âøµ) itself is rarely used in Japanese. It signifies abstract concepts combined with other characters.

ÂøµÈ°ò (nengan): wish (thought + want)

Âøµ‰ªè (nenbutsu): prayer to Buddha (thought + Buddha)

ÁêÜÂøµ (rinen): ideology (reason + thought)

‰ø°Âøµ (shin‚Äônen): conviction (belief + thought)

They are stressed out. This kind of people provoke other people to see their reactions because it energizes them. They didn‚Äôt really think you look like a terrorist. They said that to see your reactions. The best way to deal with these people is to show no emotions or reactions and to walk away.

They would have asked a gay man what a man‚Äôs penis tastes like.

They would have said to a feminist that abortion is murder.

They have no beliefs. Everything they say is what they think would get a rile out of you.

You didn‚Äôt give them any response which was the right thing to do. They were disappointed and thought, ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt react to it. How boring.‚Äù

But you are hurt. Then you are letting them manipulate you. I know it is hard but calm your emotions and force yourself to feel better. Forcing yourself is not advisable but in this case, you need it. Realize they weren‚Äôt psychologically healthy people. Declare that you will not let their unstable minds disturb your inner peace.

I have also been doing my best to be more productive. I am seeing Pentacles, especially the Eight of Pentacles. They seem to promise me success given that I continue to work hard.

It‚Äôs my ‚Äúdisease,‚Äù so I blame myself for not dealing with it sooner, but really tho, it‚Äôs totally ok to acknowledge that your surrounding environment is not helping. I think it‚Äôs actually healthier to isolate until you find better friends. 

It took me years to realize the exact reasons ‚Äúwhy‚Äù certain people/groups turned me off and made me feel depressed. Whether you‚Äôre angry or sad about ‚Äúyour friends‚Äù not caring and only offering superficial solutions, the answer is to change the environment. It‚Äôs a start anyway."

I have no objections to June being symbolic of Demi‚Äôs as well, but I have to ask myself this:

‚ÄúWhen people complain about not being represented enough compared to the people of topic of interest, aren‚Äôt they just ‚Äúall lives mattering‚Äù the original cause?‚Äù

The struggles Demi people encounter on a day-to-day basis are laughably minor when compared to how many people have been bullied into killing themselves, have been denied a job, or have been abused for existing.

Even when bi people complain during this time of year about not getting as much representation as trans, I have to eye-roll. It‚Äôs almost like the people who are presently the most affected by politics get more media attention. Not hating, that‚Äôs just how it is.

&#x200B;

Or just yolo it. If she's dating you she likes you numb nuts. And kiss her whenever you fucking feel like it. What kind of person has rules regarding number of dates before kissing? There's always a moment when it feels right, just go with the damn flow. Goddamn it. These posts trigger me. Like, just be a human and stop overthinking. And I don't mean just you, I mean you, your friends who are assholes for peer pressuring you and your damn date who's whining about not kissing when she could be the one initiating it.

3387,INFP,decider,"Unfortunately, it seems that the keto diet can cause kidney stones, although using potassium citrate can help prevent them ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17621514](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17621514)). The way I see it, a low-carb/ketogenic diet removes any substrates that the bacteria use to grow. It makes sense to ""starve"" them to death.

Another factor that I think is just as important, is the removal of excessive sugars that cause high levels of insulin in the blood. The lack of jagged sugar spikes leads to a stability of blood glucose levels that also help control inflammation, which can also affect the gut flora (which can then help control inflammation). Excessive carbohydrate intake also plays a role in inflammation (via cellular glycation).

It's all tied together.  All these chronic health issues like heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, ect., are tied to high inflammatory states, excessive weight from an excess of macronutrients, and gut permeability. I do believe a lower-carb diet, as opposed to the diet we are advised to eat (45-60% kcals from carbohydrates) can definitely help some people achieve better health."
3388,INFP,decider,"Wow, this looks very much like oil paint...nice."
3389,INFP,decider,"It's super realistic and nicely done! The color choice makes it pop out, and the shadows are where they should be.

One thing that stood out to me though, were some of the lines. Some lines (like where the snout curves, where the base of the mouth starts from the water, the whole right cheek area) are too obvious and take away from the realism that you did achieve in other areas (like literally right next to it, at the base), where you don't have lines, but gradual variations in color. Also, the water has a slight, soft, velvet look to it because it's too smooth. Other than that, it's great!"
3390,INFP,decider,"I agree with the other posts, very well done OP! Very clean technique!

In all honesty, the drawing itself makes me feel a bit anxious though...which is a positive because good art makes you feel something :) 

If I try to analyze the emotional reaction, it may be due to the jagged, sharp edges which resemble cold, broken glass, as well as the color, which is a cool blue-green, a color that lacks warmth, and when combined with the edges, takes away any soothing quality it may have. The figure seems to have its mouth closed, in which in this case, the deduction is self-explanatory.

I really hope not to offend."

3536,ISTJ,observer,"I'll quote this from a very knowledgeable source, though it does not talk about the 5:


>I‚Äôm going to use this as an opportunity to talk briefly about the enneagram.


>Your core is visible and important and serves as a constant motivator.


>Your wing is like‚Ä¶a gentle brake on the core. You probably don‚Äôt relate to it much as it‚Äôs a counterbalance. It modifies the core. It is meaningless without that context.


>If we are seeing the core as a bike and the wing as a gentle brake, the first fix is like, the bike light or panniers - a valuable asset but not critical to the driving, and the second fix is like those plastic handlebar tassels that contribute to the overall appearance of the bike somewhat but they are not at all necessary to understand the concept of a bike.


>Anyway with that in mind: if you‚Äôre a 2, you will primarily be motivated by 2 things and the 1 or 3 wing are just going to modify 2. You are not, as a person, going to see a significant influence from 1 or 3 (unless you have a 1 fix, in which case you will be motivated by 1 a much smaller amount than you are by 2). A 2 wants to be loved and does things for others because their fear is that they will not be loved, whether or not they have a 1 or 3 wing. A 2w1 will have a little bit of an underlying sense of ‚Äúit is my moral duty to be helpful‚Äù vs. a 2w3 who will have more of an attitude of ‚Äúit is valuable to be helpful‚Äù but the main thing a 2 is interested in is still being helpful, not being a perfectionist or impressive."

3628,ENFP,observer,"So, what had happened was I decided to try to get the lowest affinity level with Rei out of curiosity and I did it. Now, something a bit...eerie just happened. After a few days, suddenly Rei asked about Yan-bo and Karnulla relationships (daily talks). The choices were between ""It's Yan-bo's fault"" or ""it's just like us"". I answered the latter. Rei answered ""So, are we enemies?"" (or something like that, I kinda forgot, sorry...). Then, she talked about our current relationship and asked about whether it can be fixed or not. The choices were ""It depends on you"" and ""No"". I answered ""No"" lol. After that, she suddenly talked about this ""different ending"" from ""theirs"". I mean, who are ""they""?? Are ""they"" the other watchers? Also, did Rayark mentioned anything about possible multiple endings?

By the way, sorry that the stupid me didn't screenshot the whole conversation. If I get the same conversation again, I'll definitely give an update and recap the whole thing. Or maybe if anyone else had the same conversation, feel free to share (my memory isn't just that reliable lol).

UPDATE: FALSE ALARM. ""Theirs"" means Yan-bo and Karnulla. At the last part, Rei said ""Although Yan-bo and Karnulla can't get along, I still hold out hope that our ending would be different than theirs."". Yup, I'm a braindead."

""It's just been so long.""

""We haven't spoken for some time...""

""Just feel a little awkward, that's all.""

""......well, what's up?""

Branch 1: ""(I didn't screenshot and I forgot lol)"" / ""We aren't partners, are we?"". I choosed the second.

""But, if you've already decided how you feel, then it doesn't really matter what I say.""

Branch 2: ""So you know how I feel, don't you?"" / ""Don't try to evade the question"". Again, second.

""......then, what do you mean by partners?""

""Do you mean someone who has the same goal as you? Or is it someone who thinks about what's best for you? Despite you never asking for them to do so.""

""....yes, I understand. You still don't have the answer.""

Therefore, asking for a definitive answer... I don't think it's fair of you to demand that of me.""

Branch 3: look at the image.

""Ah...I...""

""I've never seen you so angry at me before...""

""I think that since we're always together... there's no way to clear out our emotions.""

3689,ENFJ,decider,"I have both racquets.
The 88d used by gideon is a little longer and works best when your grip is all the way down low for smashing and controlling. Itll be hard to intercept shots at the front since youll be holding it down low.

The reason i hold it down low is because the 88d is not beginning friendly in my experience. If you hit the shuttle a little to the right or left of the sweet spot, a weak shot is bound to put you at disadvantage, so the individual must be consistent. The 88skill however is a stiff racquet and feels light when swung, but remains to be average at best when trying to pressure opponents from the back of the court. With the 88d, lots of practice will be needed to get used to it, but when you do, it will pay dividends because it is lighter weight and gives you a cannon of a smash, meaning you save energy and also have a big smash.

The z force is also an advanced racquet but in a different aspect. At first try, the zf2 will feel great, the smash feels solid and big swings i.e. lifts and clears will feel awesome. However, that will all it will amount to. The reason being the sweet spot is enlarged with isometric shape. 

The downside of this racquet will be the smaller frame and head heavy effect. In doubles, more driving and fast paced smashing and defending will occur. Play will involve quick racquet skills and movement of racquet to divert smashes. High lifts for zf2 to smash will be great but dont be fooled because when it comes to driving, you may have trouble connecting shots UNLESS you have a monster forearm power. Many singles players used to used 4u and 3u zf2, but recently, racquets have been designed specifically for doubles and singles play. Although some still use zf2 in dpubles, i believe they use it only because they have been using it since they were little or for a very long time. 
"
3690,ENFJ,decider,"Perfect. I couldnt agree more. The fact that others stay to themselves are because they are bound with convictions established through cuddling up to their knees. 

They dont want the attention, but at the same time needs it to maintain an identity. So before you talk to someone, let them know where you are standing, are you there as company, a talk as a co-worker, to build a professional relationship, seeking advice, as a teacher? 
This is effectively small talk and anyone who feels as if small talking is the downfall of human interaction, you couldn't be any further from the truth. 

Therefore, if you are seeking to build relationships, dont put the weight of humiliation on them, but offer to be the one who takes the uncomfortable and warm foundation for them to rest on. Relax. 

You do, indeed, reap what you sow. "

Here‚Äôs a big one for me, if they can be in the same room with me but each individually doing our own thing and not needing to talk to fill the empty space. Why? Because that shows me we‚Äôre comfortable enough around each other. And when they notice small things and do little things for me (acts of services love language).

3710,ENFP,observer,I am usually in a really good mood and when I‚Äôm not I can pin point why I‚Äôm feeling a certain way ( I know that‚Äôs not the usual for a 7 but this one here is balanced).

This of course only happens once in a blue moon.
3711,ENFP,observer,I know a 5 that does this! I find it fascinating. I love watching it at play. There‚Äôs times where we‚Äôll be talking and they start to do this out loud in regards to what they‚Äôre feeling because they want my input. Wish I could do this.

Another idea. What if you have a few hundred index cards with different random phrases in them. Pick one randomly, leaving it facing up on the nightstand next to you but don‚Äôt look at it at all so you don‚Äôt know what it says. Read the card while astral projecting, and confirm if you‚Äôre correct when you wake up. 

Could use something like cards against humanity to make it more interesting lol.

Of course, this is all still word of mouth. Anyone could say, ‚ÄúI saw the name of a card in the astral plane and saw that it was right, I swear!!‚Äù The real way to prove astral projection would be to get someone else besides the APer to have the card laying out on a table in their locked bedroom, with the actual wording (or picture/color) of the card only being known by the person who is not astral projecting."
3718,ENTP,observer,"Nope! Which is why it‚Äôs a great story in my opinion, because she starts off as the opposite. I only wished the book was longer!"
3719,ENTP,observer,This confirms I‚Äôm a 7 lol my friend told me that this is my spirit animal
3720,ENTP,observer,Well then I guess there is no way to prove Astral Projection if apparently anything can change while you‚Äôre in the astral realm.

3723,ENTP,observer,"At first I thought it was silly too and sort of had the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù mindset around journaling, but I figured I‚Äôd try it out mainly because of experiences that I want to be able to look back on many years down the line. I loved the idea of remembering all of the things I used to do that I know I‚Äôll forget about, so I decided to make daily journaling a habit. What I didn‚Äôt expect though, is the great release I get from journaling as well. It calms my mind and allows me to think more clearly and work through things that are bothering me. I always feel more calmed and at ease after a session of journaling. Now I am obsessed with journaling, and it‚Äôs a habit that I always intend on keeping. Journaling is honestly therapeutic for me. It‚Äôs often like venting to a friend that always listens and never judges. :)"

3754,INTP,decider,"Its kinda portrayed differently in the VN. But to best explain. Yeah, Amadeus is actually the aggressor here. She's very lonely. 


By contrast Okabe wanted nothing to do with Amadeus really, for the most part. The call between classes was him ignoring her actually and she called him out on it.



Okabe is deeply conflicted to his core on this. Amadeus brings him happiness to see Kurisu, and pain from seeing Kurisu.



Slipping out of the party is, in my opinion less about him wanting to talk to amadeus instead but him wanting to ditch being around suzuha.



Remember, Suzuha for the most part hates okabe. Okabe can't look her in the eyes and basically talk to her because he knows the future he damned her to basically. He only slips out of the party to let Suzuha be, he was fine being there until Suzuha made it awkward for both of them in a way.

3795,INTP,decider,">after all this drama I got the best bj of my life.

3796,INTP,decider,I agree; he shouldn‚Äôt even have to ask.
3797,INTP,decider,">I got fired from my job today because I have not shown up the past two days. 

Really? I find that hard to believe."
3798,INTP,decider,">All was perfect before this month.

It wasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been 5 years of long distance."
3799,INTP,decider,"No. If he calls, let someone else speak to him. Do not talk to him. There is no point in the abused speaking to the abuser at this point."
3800,INTJ,observer,"Part on the right isn't finished yet. No mods were used, blank world was created in tEdit."
3801,INTJ,observer,German Reich is great as first nation to play as. Soviet Union is a little more difficult for introductory game. Italy and UK as well as US demands knowledge on how navy works. France is imo hardest to play for a new player.
3802,INTJ,observer,I used them as Private Force when I was building big projects. So far only one died.

3806,INTJ,observer,"I was inspired by... I don't really remember from where... but it was some big mansion I think, and it had a long room decorated with paintings. I know that I should have added something else but I was out of ideas and enthusiasm."

3810,INFP,decider,I would believe it if there weren't actual stairs.
3811,INFP,decider,"I mean, you're right. If he was trying to make a point about how big a problem suicide or medical errors in the USA is, then it would be fine. But he isn't. He's trying to minimize people's feelings about gun violence."

3830,INFJ,observer,"You're right, they definitely were expecting me to be a pushover. Surprise, mothafuckas!"
3831,INFJ,observer,"Good on you for sending that to be honest. I have my own list of bad experiences (I've had one good roommate out of six) and I got fed up as well, but instead of confrontation, I straight up just reported the current one."
3832,INFJ,observer,I'll have to check my lease agreement again but I don't think that applies here.
3833,INFJ,observer,"Yeah, this guy sits in their room playing video games all day. Also, she could have texted me and asked if he could stay before I showed up, or at least told me he was gonna be there for a few days. But it's been three days which is the visitor limit in our development, and I don't think he has a job which is probably why he got evicted. And they're engaged! How?! People really confuse me sometimes."
3834,INFJ,observer,"She told me face to face that he was here and when I tried to get more information she changed the subject or kept it very vague. I have no problem talking face-to-face with people. However, my last roommate was very problematic because of her love interest and I'm not willing to deal with that again considering I'm taking 18 credits and working weekends. If he wants to sit all day playing video games (not just on weekends, but on weekdays as well, for hours and hours straight) instead of getting a job to pay his rent, then he can leave. And I guarantee he's been here for longer than two days. The townhouse development has a 3 day limit on visitors."
3835,INFJ,observer,"We live in student housing. He is not a student here as far as I know. It's not like a normal apartment where anyone can live there, you must be a student and there are a lot more rules at play. She could have texted or called and told me he would be here for a few days (3 days is the limit here) but she didn't. She moved him in and told me when I showed up, assuming I would just let it slide. He's also not allowed to be here because he's not on the lease and he was evicted from the property before (if he DID go to this school before) meaning he probably wouldn't be welcomed back if he LEGALLY tried. When I went to the office, I told the leasing agent I thought it was just going to be me and the girl, because I thought maybe it had been a package deal all along and I didn't know. That's when I was told that he was not legally supposed to be there. Before I went to the office, I tried to ask the roommate questions about the situation and she kept it very vague, not telling me that he was evicted from the property and not saying how long he would be there. She should have communicated with me first."
3836,INFJ,observer,"Being a ""snitch"" is not a good reason to allow myself to deal with some bullshit. Logically, it makes more sense for me to report them. I don't know them, I don't owe them anything, and they're breaking the law, which could get me in trouble even though I haven't done anything wrong. Why would I be loyal to people like that? That's just foolish."
3837,INFJ,observer,"Maybe, but I'd rather be a snitch and get adequate study and sleep time than let it go and miss out on what I need. This is going to be my hardest semester yet. I need those things."
3838,INFJ,observer,"You're right, I didn't say anything like that. At the time I thought maybe they had signed the lease together and I just didn't know. So I went to the leasing office asking if he was supposed to be there, and then they said he wasn't. My exact words to the agent were, ""I was under the impression that it was just going to be the girl living there, but she has her fiance living there too."" I asked what the deal was and the agent said it was just supposed to be the girl and that her fiance had been evicted. She even knew the guy's first and last name and told me that other employees had reported sightings of him being there when he wasn't supposed to. Once I had this knowledge I told her I didn't want him there and she said she would send a letter."
3839,INFJ,observer,It wouldn't let me post it there so I had to compromise lol. I hope they wouldn't call me an asshole.
3840,INFJ,observer,"(Copied from a previous reply to another user.)

I spoke with her as soon as I got there. But she should have told me he was there from the beginning, or at least asked if he could stay. (I've been living in this townhouse for a year and a half and she just moved in.) I'm aware of his video gaming habits because he competes in tournaments (which she posted on Facebook a few weeks prior to me coming back) and because today is now Tuesday and he's been playing games since I left at 9:15 this morning. She also told me to my face that he stays up late playing games most nights. I told her I'm a light sleeper, I have a packed schedule, I told her when I typically go to bed, get up, etc and that his habits should not inhibit sleep or study time. Which they absolutely will."

3844,INFP,decider,"I feel like these guys are the mostly likely ones to tell you stuff like 'You're not acting like the girl I fell in love with!' or 'Don't do that, you don't wanna be like (insert stereotype) do you? '"
3845,INFP,decider,"""How can I make this about me and things I believe instead of listening? Its really, REALLY important that this is about me or I'll start having a tantrum."""
3846,INFP,decider,"As a side note: Has anyone else here kinda grown a resentment toward people appreciating your ""uniqueness"" and thinking process when its convenient for them but treating you like a second-class citizen at other times? Like, my job loves my hyper-focus when it benefits them but at meetings no one wants to acknowledge that they're friendly to me. Maybe that sounds bad, but that's how it comes off.

&#x200B;

I guess I should add as a sidenote for context: I work in an environment that is very focused on status despite most people here's insistence that they are not. Its highly academic. I don't run into this issue so much outside of work."
3847,INFP,decider,"I've seen this all over reddit today and all I can think is: Can you imagine how embarassing it would be if your parents had a Reagan or Nixon-themed wedding? Like, explaining that to friends when they run across the photos. ""Yeah, they were, uh...really into the Republican party..."""

3852,ENFP,observer,What program did you use to make it?
3853,ENFP,observer,"I'd say i try to neutralise conflicts if possible. I am generally a very lighthearted and kind of indifferent person so i don't take a lot of stuff/people seriously. It depends on how far people push me. If it gets serious i try to resolve the conflict once and for all so i won't bother with it again. (Keep in my mind my 8 wing is not extremely strong, however i relate to it way more than i do to w1)."
3854,ENFP,observer,"Tests aren't the most reliable source. So, if you're interested i would recommend doing a little research on the cognitive functions cause they are what makes MBTI a personality system."
3855,ENFP,observer,"Well, i'd say i expect to be respected and just kind of reasonable ( but i guess that's because of the 9, maybe?) but to be honest it is relatively hard for me to show or express my emotions (strong emotions) to the person i talk to because i think of it as sort of showing vulnerability and i don't want to be vulnerable at all. I've always tended to hide my emotions, however i definitely feel things just internally and i won't express it. Thanks for your help, man and sorry for bothering you. :D"
3856,ENFP,observer,"I see. By the way, would the 952 be more affectionate than the 953? I have heard that 3's are out of contact with their emotions and tend not to express them so that one of the reason i thought i had a 3 fix but i think the 2 will have a hard time being emotionally expressive because of the 9 and 5, right?"
3857,ENFJ,decider,Congrats!! It makes me so happy to see someone succeed. And it seems like it was rough to get there and you didn't give up. I'm really happy for you :)

3860,ENFJ,decider,"That's not cool, if you think he is being an asshole talk to him about it, if he doesn't change then well it's not on you. But this punishment will make you an asshole and also will make you an abusive partner. So yeah, communication above all else because an episode is really horrible and if you want that to him because of his behaviour then you're not that different..."
3861,ENFJ,decider,"I loved it, the orange mixing with the blue and purple, the small specks of yellow, the white that seems like a mist... You're really good at painting :)"
3862,ENFJ,decider,"Well, I don't think anyone deserves to be abused and you should talk to him about it like I said, if you remain unhappy get out of this relationship because is not for you... And if you love him why'd you ask how to make him have an episode?"
3863,ENFJ,decider,"I dont know you but I'm not disappointed at you. I mean you came this far (and you actually didn't punch your brother in law in the face (something I would do :p))  you are not emotionally weak, you are emotionally strong, you can handle mental illness, this is not something someone emotionally weak or psychologically weak would be able to do. We are here for you to help you fight against society, to help you with your downs and ups. If you want to chat I'm here for you and I know a lot of people also are... Also it doesn't matter who you were(it's nice to remember but don't think to much about it), it matters who you are and I see someone who is a fighter who came a long way, you are just tired of fighting, and that's ok, take your time, we will always be here for you. Don't know if that will help but here it is."

If you want to talk or anything feel free to pm me, you're not alone :)"
3867,ENFJ,decider,"Still think you should talk to him first, but if you just want this """"revenge"""" then you're also an asshole and you should go talk to someone about it because abusing someone is not cool, and if you're happy why do this? If you love him why do this?  Not cool"

3904,ESTP,observer,"Fe-Ni-Se-Ti **ENFJ**

You really value connections to people and make them feel welcome (Fe). Also a lot of ENFJs can be really quiet because of Ni in the second place. You look into people's emotions (Fe) and you feel strongly that something is wrong in people (Ni) so you can give them good experience via Se. ""I connect with people, see beauty in everything, i sing, i share myself with others, I am active, I laugh loud and lots"" also points to Se.

>I am timid, hesitant, sensitive, insecure, alwaysalways worrying about others, hostile, hard to talk to, uninterested, spaced out, pushing people away, and unproductive.

You overanalyse people's intention when you're unable to use Fe due to stress, so your Ti is weak. Your inferior Ti also explains why you might feel insecure about your own emotions when you try to analyse them."
3905,ESTP,observer,ESTJ (Te-Si-Ne-Fi) with very close Si-Ne strength.
3906,ESTP,observer,"**Here! We! Go!**

>I like learning new things but lose interest quickly once my skill level plateaus. Jack of all trades master of none, which annoys me to no end 

Ne and Se

>I do this all the time and I feel great. This is the definition of my optimal weekend. 

You need downtime to reflect yourself, indicating you have a leading introvert function (either Ti or Fi)

So we have INTP, ISTP, INFP or ISFP to choose from.

>Not exercising has negative implications for my mental health. It‚Äôs important for me to be strong and physically able.

You seem to pay attention to your inner body, so I can sense Si.

>I‚Äôm always trying to plan ahead, and all of my plans seem to have backup plans and several branches of possibilities so that I can have a response to all eventualities. That said, I seldom follow through on my plans and don‚Äôt actually ever commit to them because I‚Äôm too fond of keeping my doors open (which is at the root of my career woes). 

The first part is Ne because you enjoy exploring possibilities. Caring about backup plans means that you seek security and stability, so you have Si. But you love possibilities first before stability, so you have Ne 2nd and Si 3rd.

>The future is full of (too many) possibilities. The present is the gateway into the future. I have to do my best now to achieve my ideal (future) self. 

obvious Ne-Si

>I analyse the situation, the context, what brought me here, where I am, why I was brought here, and if appropriate, how I can get out. If I will be let out after a short period of time and don‚Äôt need to actively plan escape scenarios, I will...This is ridiculous, I have no context, why would anyone hold me in a blank, empty room against my will if they don‚Äôt harbor some sort of hostile or suspicious intentions toward me? 

Wow this is very Ti!

> Having to sell myself makes me uncomfortable. Having to sell anything. Networking. Being forced to socialize with strangers for no discernible purpose. Not being prepared enough also makes me very uncomfortable.  

Inferior Fe, wanting to get connected but unsure if you can actually do it.

>It depends on what they would like me to do. I will listen and have a strong inclination to help. They came to me in their time of need and trusted that my skills, experience, or wisdom would be able to help them. It must be that I can do something, validate this trust and strengthen our friendship? Then again, this applies to people who know me. If the request is non-specific to me and / or ridiculous / not a good investment of my resources, then I will turn it down in some non-harmful way.

Also weak Fe, you're aware of the fact you want to help people

**INTP** yay!"
3907,ESTP,observer,">I can say I'm **somewhat curious**. So if people do activities that I think it's fun like sport stacking, playing Jenga, ice skating, flipping bottle, freestyle football/basketball, playing fidget spinner, etc I always want to try it. Or food that I've never tried before, or places I've never visit.... **I rarely actually do it though, but I do want to try it if I get the chance (I've tried some of what I said above and I want to do it again when I get the chance)**. So my curiosity is mostly about fun activities like said above.

Being curious and eager to try different things points to Ne, so you have Ne somewhere in your function stack.

>I would create a relaxing environment where everyone don't have to be afraid of me. **I want them to treat me as their friend instead of their leader**.

&

> If I decide to help the person it's because I'm sure I can do what the person want me to do. **And helping people can make them happy so I'll feel satisfied when I can help them**. 

Clear Fe

>The past is when everything already happened. **Honestly before 2013 I almost never live in the past but after it I almost always live in the past. I can't stop feeling nostalgic.** I know I shouldn't focus on the past but what if 2013 was the best year in my life? **I want to come back to 2013 when everything was better.**  

This is Si, so you're basically strengthening Si over time. Wishing to go back and relive experiences shows Si because you feel good when you look back to the past, regardless of whether you should focus on the past or not.

>When I learn something I need a **detailed step by step** explanation of how to do it, **repetition** and clear expectations.  

This learning style is Si that is wanting to make sure you do anything correctly and perfectly.

>I'm an indecisive person. It takes a long time to make a decision because I don't want to make a wrong decision. If it's an important decision usually I won't change my mind once I made the decision. But then I see a better option and I think ""Ugh, why I didn't choose that?? I wish I haven't made this decision so I can choose that."" 

Considering many factors before making a decision to make sure nothing goes wrong is Si. So 1st Si confirmed.

>Personally my aspiration is letting go of my fears so I can live my life to the fullest and really experience things. Being more outgoing and assertive so nobody would treat me as a doormat again. I don't know what's my aspiration is professionally but for now my aspiration is getting a job (if it counts lol) 

Your fear is related to uncertainty in future ""What could go wrong?"" You want to leave comfort zone, showing your Ne development against your Si. This is clearly Ne inferior (4th).

&#x200B;

so now Ne is 4th, Si 1st and you have Fe, congrats you are an **ISFJ**!"
3908,ESTP,observer,"When I'm under massive stress I just become really quiet and withdraw from people. I think there's no point bashing or projecting my anger towards others because it can do more harm instead of alleviating the situation. And yes I always have problems with imagining myself even in one year's time (what job I'll take, which country I'll end up moving to). I once had a conspiracy theory that all of my friends agreed to ignore and cut out any contact with me.

3911,ESTP,observer,"I don't think using outside sources is cheating, but some people do because it would either make you score way more easily, or reduce the duration of an individual game. In my opinion, even more interesting are ""techniques"" you would make use of external assistance to bring yourself from the street view to the map 'accurately'.

So you prefer outside help... how about limiting yourself to 45-50 minutes for the whole game and get less than 10 metres apart in each map? Not easy as it seems, but maybe still easy for others."

**Say it louder for the people in the back!**

>No matter what, you aren't ""taking care of your own orgasm"" unless you're masturbating after the fact or ignoring your partner entirely. Which is what people think when you suggest they take care of it *themselves*, AKA *without their partner being part of it.* 

I also get this impression when I hear people talking about ""taking matters into your own hands"", cause it's like, if I solely wanted to take matters into my hands then I wouldn't have sex with another person... I would masturbate alone.

Plus, if I'm engaging in making sex pleasurable for the person who I'm being intimate with and making sure he's having the best experience, etc, then why wouldn't I also be deserving of having him do the same for me? *Takes two to tango.*

I saw OP mention in a reply that ""never had a bad experience with it \[having bad partners\]"" and maybe that's why OP says that?

Meaning, people who normally say that ""you should take matters into your own hands"" are people who never had bad partners?

Genuinely asking cause I'm interested in hearing if maybe there's a correlation?

Cause honestly, when you have a bad partner, trying to or ""taking matters into your owns hands"" doesn't improve it.

So yeah, don't settle for bad situations and always remember that you are the most important person in your life, and if another person is not willing to take care of you, love you, etc like you do for them, then maybe you should leave and dedicate yourself to you.

The astronaut in the video watching television tries to break away from his attachment to the media and realizes a barren and dystopian world.  The television represents, well, the media.  The grey men with QR codes represent those who consume media, who are reduced to mere husks enslaved to what the media shows.  Toward the end of the video, the astronaut finds himself lying on the ground of grey dust, detached from the media, realizing his place in the universe and the true face of the world, which, as the title suggests, is **nothing**.  Upon noticing the door, he runs toward any sign of meaning and hope in this world, only to find himself running back to the fabrications offered by the media, sitting in front of his television.  Even if his life is a meaningless lie, it's preferable to the dystopian world outside of it.  I'm sure others could tie this to a more concrete idea but this is what I came up with.

4029,INTP,decider,"As a veteran of the US Military, I can promise you that no weapon you can legally purchase in the United States would do you any good against a first-rate army. Your AR-15 wouldn't help you against a Stryker with the hatches closed, let alone an Apache helicopter or an Abrams tank. Unless you propose making Stingers and RPG-7s street-legal.

Assuming that it was legal, there is absolutely no way that a rebellion could afford the necessary equipment. A stinger, for example, costs $38,000.00 a pop. Most successful guerrilla organizations have a foreign government bankrolling and arming them them, those that don't tend to have problems; look at how quickly ISIS ran out of money. No country anyone want to be allies with is going to finance a civil war in the United States, nor would they be able to smuggle in supplies past the worlds argest navy and air force so you're fucked there.

Assuming they could miraculously afford it, they would still get mopped up because most of them won't have the training (which is a somewhat manageable problem, assuming they can attract enough veterans) or the organization (a much bigger problem) to fight effectively. And unlike the Taliban or the Viet Cong, they wouldn't have the benefit of home-field advantage. They'll have to deal with being ratted out by their colleagues, as government moles and sympathizers penetrated their organization.

I'd add in to that and advise OP to track his current spendings, while planning for the future ones.

Plan for the eventuality that you lose your job, build up the savings for that. (It is important since you will be in a single income household).

I took note of the comments OP made, ""my house"" ""my kids"" ""my wife is a spender"", which is why I am advising to track spendings. Most partners who don't run the household (since it's clearly his wife who runs it, with him being away for 2 weeks at a time) don't really know the actual costs associated to running a household.  

It would be important for OP to track the spendings and realise how much the wife is actually spending on herself v/s on the household/kids, because that might become an issue in the future with the whole family depending on the OP's salary.

Better be safe than sorry!"

First, you don't want to be tied down to one state - i am not a doctor but I follow a couple youtubers who are, and I learned about the process of 'matching' - you might not even get 'matched' in that specific state, or that state might not have the speciality you want to go into, etc etc.

Secondly, what if something (pray otherwise) happens, and that you can't or don't want to complete your med schooling anymore, that would leave you with a lot of debt at a high interest rate, which will for sure not be forgiven.

I don't understand why you would want to borrow the maximum amount when you don't even know if you actually need the maximum amount, only thinking about the 'forgiveness' part - that's not really smart/not thinking ahead. You should always plan for the non-perfect scenario.

How long did you guys date before getting married?

How can you be married and not know exactly why she isn't wearing her wedding band?

**Where is the communication and understanding?**

Instead of freaking out, you should have tried to dig deeper into the root cause, perhaps, as some suggested before me, your wife has never worn a ring before and she simply forgets? Perhaps she doesn't know how much it means to you? Did you have a sit down and explained it to her?

Perhaps she is still getting used to the idea of being married?

Perhaps she works somewhere that would explain that?

I am also confused, is she wearing the engagement ring and not the wedding band or is she not wearing both?"

Other than the fact that the anaesthetist overdosed me to the point where I couldn't pee for 2 hours after the surgery, and the horrible half melted cup vanilla ice cream that they gave me post surgery, and the 1 week of convalescence of having to eat liquids and soft foods (that was the worst i think - i love food and was craving for fried chicken!) I never once felt any pain at all.

In terms of the operation itself, two of my wisdom teeth were pulled out full, and two were cut in half. I got to keep them! They're HUGE! I had to have them removed because I have a small jaw. The taste of blood in my mouth for a couple days after the surgery was annoying (iron tasting).

If I had to have m wisdom teeth removed again, i'd do this surgery again. My dad didn't want me to have general anaesthesia because he was scared I would never wake up, but if you go to a good hospital/clinic, there's not much you have to worry about. Of course it costs much more than a simple extraction at your regular dentist. In my country, not all dentists do wisdom teeth removal. And even those who do, won't do more than 1-2 at a time. I didn't want to prolong the recovery period and not be able to eat properly for months, so I preferred to go all in and deal with the inconveniences of recovery just once.

Prior to the surgery, I had to have my jaw x-rayed, to see where the teeth are and stuff, then book an appointment with the clinic for removal. The procedure may vary depending on where you are from.

Reddit makes more per upvote in ad revenue than the propagandists make in profit. The only reason the sound-bites make it sound like they have extremely high profits is because of the sheer volume of what they sell. If you sell an item which cost you $4.00 for $4.01, 140 billion times (~ number of gallons consumed per year in USA), you just made 1.4 billion dollars. However, since the big 5 oil companies are on track to make $140 billion in profits this year, they are actually making $1 per gallon in profits, not $.01. If the gummint comes in & taxes you an additional 1%, you make only $.96 per gallon!!! For the record...the so-called ""subsidies"" are actually <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/business/04bptax.html"">much higher than the subsidies for other industries.</a>

4166,INTP,decider,"You're right, much occult literature is written in a  ""vague"" style of speaking and writing. It's generally for one of the following reasons a) to train you to *think* differently (which I think is your particular problem in this case), b) to explain the intangible, spiritual, or difficult to grasp through metaphor, or term of art, and/or c) to deliberately conceal for various reasons. 

Many of the ""you are asking the wrong question"" type answers are because of the first reason. They are trying to encourage to think beyond your current world view (which is probably, if you are like most modern beginners, some kind of scientific materialism, cartesian rationalism, or atheism). The purpose of answering questions with questions is intended to stimulate your imagination and intuitive faculties. This is a crucial first step to beginning to think like a magician, and it can't be skipped over.  Why, because yes magick heavily deals with the mind and subconscious.

The other reason, of course, why there is so much  vague information, is the usual watering down that happens when something becomes popular or trendy and fashionable. That happens in every field, on the internet.

Edit: I realized I didn't give any real practical advice what to actually do about this problem. So here is what I want you to do: 1) put down the beginner books about ""magick""- these are pretty much useless to you right now anyhow. 2) Pick up some practical books on world mythology/religion, folklore, and psychology (Carl Jung ""Man and His Symbols"" is good place to start).  After you've done this for a while and have trained yourself to start thinking through myth and symbolism a little bit, continue to stay away from the ""beginner magick books"" for now and do this instead:  
1) Start a dream journal and record your dreams every day, and start analyzing some of your personal symbols and archetypes 2) Buy a tarot deck and get used to thinking intuitively through symbol and correspondences.  Once you've followed through these steps, come back and ask again, and read through your beginner books again."

But many people continue to have these idealized and romanticized notions of what ""motherhood"" is supposed to look like. Endlessly giving, endlessly selfless, graceful, and nurturing...but that isn't very realistic. 

 It's why JP wrote a rule about not letting your children turn into someone you don't like... because if you can't respect your children (and let them walk all over you), you might start resenting them...and if you start resenting your children, you can grow bitter, mean, cruel.. 

These kinds of unrealistic expectations are a big reason why some women may fear motherhood and  think they just aren't ""perfect"" or ""maternal enough"" to have kids."
4169,INTP,decider,"This is actually pretty common, and I believe the reason is because sexuality is like you say, a deeply personal and individual thing. Sex has a way of tapping into our innermost subconscious thoughts and desires. If you are familiar with the term ""subspace"" you may be familiar with the different changes in consciousnesses that can occur. 

When we strongly identify as one thing, this creates a shadow, so to speak, which is essentially the opposite of everything we consciously identify as. The solution isn't to further surpress your subconscious desires, but to bring them to light,  and seek more balance in your every day life. The more confident and secure you feel in your  femininity as a whole, and the more comfortable you feel expressing that in your daily life, the less  imbalanced these subconscious desires will become. 

I think often it is the case, as feminists, we may harbor a lot of unresolved insecurities about femininity. From an early age we learn from society to think of femininity as a weakness and something that must be dominated and  overcome, in order to compete on a level playing field. That can become a complex that we  then act out in our subconscious and sexual fantasy. Whether you are finding yourself with a desire to dominate and degrade others, or to be dominated and degraded yourself. "
4170,INTP,decider,Their label art is beautiful. I have all the ones released so far...the empty bottles make nice decorations and crafts. The wine itself is not bad either for the price range.
4171,INTP,decider,"I think anyone who has ever worked for a time in low wage, support, or service oriented jobs can relate to this. After a while, being in a position where you are always having to wear a mask and be agreeable all day long, it can start to bleed over into other areas of your non work life and impact your self confidence/self worth and relationships."
4172,INTP,decider,"If I had to speculate, just based on my own dreams, it seems to often be the case that dream characters will take on the shape of people we know or have seen in real life. Sometimes people we may know in person, but also sometimes strangers, famous people, or characters in literature/film, etc.  It's almost as if they wear different ""faces"" or ""masks"" depending on the types of archetypes we associate most with that person/persona. 

 In other words, its likely your ""mother"" in the dream represents symbolically something you associate with a feminine or mother archetype. And since our father/mother is usually the first image of the opposite sex we inherrent as a child, this becomes a sort of ""default"" masculine/feminine image in our psyche.  

In my opinion, the father/mother archetype represents our received knowledge and wisdom that has been inherited and passed down, but not necessarily examined. The process of individuation involves beginning to see ourselves as differentiated from the mother/father image--but this is often a source of anxiety and confusion. "
4173,INTP,decider,The career *after* the baby is way easier than the baby after the career... actually yeah that makes so much sense and I find it to be true in my own experience. Sometimes I think we have it backwards.
4174,INTP,decider,">And my own theory: this is why almost every romance novel ends after the female lead decides on the man. Nothing else is shown afterwards. We readers don‚Äôt care.

Partly that is the case because romance and coming of age stories like this are for the young. They end when the protagonist finally reaches the last initiation rite and milestone into full adulthood (which traditionally for girls would have been marriage). Not a whole lot is said about life after the fact, in general. 

I can't find the video now where he talks about it, but I believe this is a theory JP has touched upon on briefly, that culturally we lack many archetypes dealing with life over the age of 30. And that this may be part of the reason why many young people today struggle to grow up.  One possible explanation is that this is about the age that many of our traditional religious, mythic, and cultural icons have died. For example, Jesus was executed at around the age of 30.  It is a bit hard to imagine now in modern times, but average life expectancy in ages past was not much beyond 30 or 40 years for many people...and many were lucky to make it out of childhood at all.  And so many of our heroic myths and stories revolve heavily around youth and coming of age.  Even now in modern times, most pop culture is heavily youth oriented and is marketed mainly to people under 25.

Also, romance novels depend on conflict and romantic tensions to work... if we want to assume the couple is happily married and together at the end (which of course we do!), then there's not much story left to tell. At least not about the romance itself. ;)"
4175,INTP,decider,"No, you should use your intuition to infer the meaning as they appear, in context of your question. The particular meaning may change and have a different nuance from reading to reading. That fluidity is what you want to eventually achieve. If your assigned meanings are too rigid, then you will start to lean too much on  literal interpretations, and not your intuition to derive meaning out of them. Pentacles will come to always signify money, etc. But that's just one layer of possible meaning. The cards are onions. They have layers. ;)

So, start by thinking of each card as a general archetype, representing a set of ideas, principles, etc.  Within each, there are lots of associated symbols, and a lot of possible applications of those ideas. 

For example, looking at the Suits. We have Wands, Cups, Swords, and Coins/Pentacles. These correspond loosely to the classical elements- Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.  The element of Fire can refer to literal physical fire, but usually doesn't. It stands for concepts like Intuition, Passion, Will, Drive,  etc. Pentacles correspond to Earth. It has associated meanings concerning the material realm, practicality, groundedness, the physical body, sensuality, work, craft, etc. The associated meaning of ""money"" comes out of that concept. But so could, say,  sex. The King of Pentacles could be a sensual, or practical hard working man, who takes care of physical needs. Or it might not be a person at all, but suggesting this quality in yourself, or in a situation. 

But for purposes of learning, if it helps you to associate each with a person or character that reminds you of these qualities, you can certainly use it. I would assign each one a figure (or several) from myths. For example, The Devil card got assigned Pan and Dionysus, to remind me of positive meanings to the card as well.

It seems pretty unbelievable she would be feeling up to Chinese food and ice cream immediately after a procedure like an abortion, don't most experience some physical side effects immediately after like nausea and cramping? And some are sick for a few days?  If it's real, it probably doesn't represent the norm, even if many do feel relief after."
