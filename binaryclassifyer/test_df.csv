5,INFJ,observer,"Yeah Google translate is the Mafia Boss of the entire r/softwaregore.

A few years ago I had to make an essay for my English class. We had 2 days to do it, as the procastinating genius that I am, I did it 1 hour before and I had to use Google Translate. I translated a sentence and then added ""xd"", the translation changed, then added another ""xd"", the sentence translation changed again, and then over and over I did that, until I got to the point where the sentence ""Shut up you face-bread"" changed (with 27 ""xd"" involved) to ""Shut up you face bread bread faced bread"". Yeah... Cool...

The essay was about online bullying and I had to do a comment insulting a kid, don't ask me why."

7,INFJ,observer,"Silver I (Gold III MMR tho)

I like to call the jungler for help, if Zed is good, he'll dodge your second W (juking or with his own W) and end up killing you. If I have any opportunity to kill him I will, but I won't force it much.

Then I think roaming botlane / toplane is a good idea, as you can get kills and be ahead of Zed. You can also invade his jungle to get deep wards, which would be very helpful for your team.

When fighting Zed, I usually ult after he ults, if not, he'll end up dodging your R and (probably) your W aswell, and killing you. If you ult after him, you kill him 100% if you're ahead.

32,INTJ,observer,"Hi everyone. I'm trying to use diesel with an Sqlite database so that I can have persistence in a simple application. I kind of understand how it can generate code from the migrations.

However, ultimately I intend for the application to be run by users and so I would like my application to be able to instantiate a database when it first launches without having to make my users run Sqlite commands or use the \`diesel\` command line utility to run migrations.

Does anyone have any pointers on how I can just have my standalone application create the Sqlite DB when it first launches? I'm very noob at databases. Thanks!"

34,INTJ,observer,"Hi all,

I'm still trying to get my head around the borrow checker and I am having problems with the ""no two mutable references at once"" rule when it comes to the `&mut self` parameter in struct methods. For example:

    #[derive(Debug)]
        struct Struct {
            x: u64
        }
    
        impl Struct {
            fn method(&mut self) {
                println!(""struct is {:?}"", self);
            }
        }

    fn test() {
        let mut x = Struct{x: 42};
        let y = &mut x;
        y.method();
        println!(""y is {:?}"", y);
    }

In the function `test()`, when calling `y.method()`, does there exist *two* mutable references to `x`? The first is `y` in scope of `test()`, the second is `self` in the `Struct::method()` scope? I'm really interested as to the semantics of why this works? Thanks!"

Males under 18 also have a higher chance of producing a mentally disabled child.

73,ISTJ,observer,"A lot of the mbti type descriptions are filled with stereotypes that might not be accurate for you. The best way to judge which type you are is to look at the cognitive functions and which ones you use the most. 

I am an ISTJ and a 9w8 which is uncommon for ISTJ. Istjs are typically described as perfectionists and always by the book and basically robots with a human exterior which I do not relate to. I am not a perfectionist and I am too lazy to go by the book all the time (unless it’s for a serious activity that I am unfamiliar with). However, I know for sure that I am an ISTJ because I use SiTeFiNe. 

So I would try to stay away from 16personalities because they tend to describe the types in a stereotypical, one dimensional way. So I would suggest reading up on cognitive functions and seeing which ones fit the most for you. 

Based on all of your answers on here, the way you described yourself was similar to INTJ. But I would also check out ISTJ. INTJs are more likely to be visionary and future oriented, while ISTJ tends to be more focused on daily life and makes decisions based off of what they know worked in the past. 

I hope that you find your accurate mbti type!"

84,ESFP,observer,"I'll start! I'd say about 80% of my wardrobe these days is thrifted and I've figured out some useful tips and tricks that make the hunt easier and more rewarding:

-Look through absolutely everything. Plan on spending a good couple hours in the store. You might be missing a great find by skimming through the racks. 

-Shop all sizes/sections; too-big items can have a cool slouchy fit and often items are stuck in the wrong size section anyway. Some of my best finds are from the men's section. Lots petite women find clothes in the kid's section, too.

-Going off that, try *everything* on if possible, especially if the store won't take returns

-If you're not savvy with a needle and thread and won't bother taking items to a tailor, don't buy anything that doesn't fit in a way you like. If you are, don't buy anything that will require such an extensive fix that you'll never get around to it.

-On the other hand, some simple alterations can take an item from dated to really modern and cool. I buy a lot of oversized jackets/blazers in cool 80s prints and rip the shoulder pads out to give them a more modern silhouette. 

-Learn to spot quality. If it's pilled or worn looking, pass on it. Study up on what makes a quality garment, like the cut, material, and stitching. Learn which brands are usually indicative of good quality and which aren't, and don't be afraid to google a brand you don't know. Brands aren't everything but definitely are a good starting point. I'll always pass on anything F21/H&M in the thrift store, but I'll take a second glance at something from Ann Taylor or Eileen Fisher. 

-In a similar vein, learn how good quality material (silk, cashmere, pima cotton) feels to the touch so that you can run your hand along the racks and single out the good stuff. 

-Look at care instructions. You'll want to wash it right away before wearing it. If it's dry clean only, will you bother to take it to the dry cleaner? If not, does it look like it'll hold up to a gentle hand wash? If not, don't buy something you won't even get around to washing. "
85,ESFP,observer,"Yes! I love this! Enjoy being single—I was a serial dater once, too, and now I've been single for 2 years and have enjoyed every second of it.

87,ESFP,observer,Both siblings with the same sexual boundary issues screams sexual abuse to me.
88,ESFP,observer,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately and what it means to buy ""investment pieces"". 

I think even classic pieces are going to change as trends do. For example, jeans and a t-shirt will always be classic. But that description is pretty generic. If you pick out even the most basic jeans and t-shirt outfit today, chances are it'll look dated in 10 years. Subtle things like the cut of jeans and the cut of the t-shirt are still going to eventually start looking dated (and then eventually come back again). Think bootcut jeans, skinny jeans, mom jeans, bell bottoms, kick flares, any type of jeans--they're all tied to a specific time and set of trends. T-shirts probably less so, but subtle changes will make a difference.

Hell, even colors and fabrics in and of themselves can be tied to a specific set of trends in time, before they've even been turned into a garment. 

This isn't to say that there aren't classics items. I would say pencil skirts, blazers, leather jackets, basic heels and flats are all classic. But there's still a lot of room for interpretation within those pieces. What color/texture/fabric/print? Details on a blazer or hardware color on a leather jacket? Round or pointed toe on shoes? 

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that trends vary so wildly that it's almost impossible to find something that's truly classic. Things that are are likely to be plain black with no detail or uniqueness in cut whatsoever. There is a place for clothes that are so neutrally basic; IMO, those are the pieces you should treat as ""investments"" because they're not going to go out of style, because they don't really *have* a style. 

Now, I say this as somebody who does a lot of thrift shopping. I have a lot of pieces that are straight out of the 80s or 90s and they look like it. It might be trendy now, it might not be. I love that look. It's just not classic because it looks like x decade's trends. 

Again, this is something that I think carefully about when I'm considering an 'investment piece'. We are all looking at clothes through the lens of current trends, whether we like it or not, whether we think we're influenced by trends or not. Even the people who are designing our clothing are influenced by (or creating) our current trends when they design what they think are classic pieces. What might look classic right now might not in x year's time. "
89,ESFP,observer,"I think they read very ""sorority girl in the South"". If that's your thing, go for it I guess. I don't think they're tacky in the way that the tramp stamp/whale tail thing of the 2000s is tacky, but I do agree with the other comments here that they're kinda useless and not particularly stylish IMO. "
90,ESFP,observer,">(although I always love good coping-with-depression tips).

Hi friend! I have depression too. I feel a lot better when I'm keeping myself busy, seeing friends/family, getting out of the house in some way or another. Not sure if this is the case for other people with depression, but I'm a mega extrovert and being around people really helps. The hard part is actually getting out of bed and getting the motivation to do something. 

My therapist said something to me the other day that really stuck with me and I figured I'd share it with you too. I told her I didn't do something because I didn't feel like it. She told me that ""feelings shouldn't dictate our actions."" Feelings can shape how we approach problems or challenges, but ""I don't feel like it"" isn't a good enough reason to not do something.

It's helped me a lot because when I've made plans to see family or something and I'm debating canceling but the only reason for doing so is that I don't feel like it, that's not good enough. If I end up doing whatever I needed to do anyway I always feel a lot better afterward. Again, YMMV but that was a good little nugget of wisdom I wanted to share. Take care! :)"
91,ESFP,observer,"As a Californian, I can verify that water is cold as fuck"
92,ESFP,observer,"The ""don't be dirty"" marketing makes me really sad. I've seen a lot of advertising lately (geared toward pre-teens and teens, it seems like) that seems to suggest that washing your face and getting ""clean"" will rid you of all skin woes. Why perpetuate the idea that acne is caused by ""dirt"" when really, it's mostly hormones and genetics? Marketing like this makes people with acne feel like shit about themselves and encourages clear-skinned people to see acne sufferers as dirty people who don't wash their face. I wish these companies would market their products in a way that encourages a good, effective routine for acne sufferers instead of pushing the idea that drying the fuck out of your face will magically cure your skin woes.

105,ENTP,observer,"Practice! 

I know that seems like a non-answer but let me explain. 

The first time you ever ride a rollercoaster it is scary as hell. But if you rode that rollercoaster over and over again you would eventually become bored. This is a technique used by psychologists to treat anxiety disorders. It is called exposure therapy.

On the flip side, if you actively avoid riding a rollercoaster you train your brain into thinking that you have avoided real danger. This increases fear.

By actively exposing yourself to social situations repeatedly, you will decrease your fear. When you are less fearful you can learn social skills more effectively. When you have more social skills you are less socially awkward. 

I recommend going to a Meetup and start by being in a mode of gathering data rather than regurgitating it i.e. be more of a listener than a talker. Take mental notes of ""lines"" people use to make the conversation go smoothly. With this and time, you will become a social warrior."

The reason I have two answers is that there are two different kinds of Christianity that you have to denounce before becoming an atheist. 

REASON 1

The first kind of Christianity believes everything in the Bible happened LITERALLY. They think the flood actually happened, the Earth was created in a week, there was a land of milk and honey, and many other things. This type of Christianity also believes that God is literally a man that sits on a cloud and watches everything you do. Not only has the bible been disproven by history and science, but it has also shown god to be an evil person. Putting people in hell because they don't believe you exist? Sure why not. Wiping out firstborn children because their dads were misbehaving? Seems reasonable. There are many other examples, but these alone would have me turn against the Christian God just because of the sheer evilness.

REASON 2

The second kind of Christianity suggests that the Bible is a series of parables and should not be taken literally. Instead, it should be used to derive moral lessons. They also believe God to be ""first cause."" That is, he is the reason why anything exists. This kind of Christianity, to me, is more reasonable and harder to argue with. I agree that some great life lessons can be learned from the Bible; I also agree that scientists current explanation for where the universe came from is too similar to the concept of a free energy device. It breaks the law of thermodynamics. In the end, I still turn this form of Christianity down because I can take moral lessons from the Bible without being Christian as I can with any other religious texts, and God being ""first cause"" doesn't give me any reason to turn around and start worshipping him. It gives me no benefit to give an ounce of my energy to some Almighty creator who can't even talk to me because he is some abstract concept rather than a man on a cloud.

THE END RESULT

I am happier now that I'm an atheist and I'm also worse off now that I'm an atheist. I feel like I know the truth, in that no one really knows what's going on. When I look around I see people afraid of death because no one knows what that really means. I think religions spring up to help ease our existential burden. They give certain explanations so that you do not have to be afraid of dying or having a meaningless life. The value in religion is that it gives you security and the evilness of religion is that it gives you security. I struggle with extreme existential depression now that I've left my religion. But in the end it is made me a better person. I value people more, I value the people in my life more, I value my time more, and I'm overall a nicer and and kinder person. I have gained wisdom, character, and love in exchange for my happiness."
114,ENTP,observer,I think the downvotes proves my point. I can't uplift men without getting hate.
115,ENFJ,decider,"Wow that was so nice of them, I almost feel bad for all the times I criticized the game "
116,ENFJ,decider,"I'm so happy they're giving us an event with so many notebooks and a prize that's not so great. I mean, it's house pride, I feel like they should put the best outfits in crest events since we can win them if we want, and leave stuff like this to house pride given that almost nobody manages to get the first prize there "
117,ENFJ,decider,This is the content I play this game for
118,ENFJ,decider,"Wait, have you done Blackwall's companion quest in Inquisition?
If you haven't, he shouldn't be available anymore as a party member "
119,ENFJ,decider,"Man I really hope so, once I dreamt that his route was gonna go all furry and I woke up terrified"
120,ENFJ,decider,"I liked the first season of Sunshine much more than the ones with the μ's actually, it felt more realistic"

125,ENFP,observer,THE GATEWAY HAS OPENED! HIDE YOUR WALLET! welcome tho.
126,ENFP,observer,"I have both and love both :]

Eco: more nib options (interchangeable), much better ink capacity (piston fill, requires ink bottle), demonstrator (it's clear so you can see how much ink you have left) and looks dope.

Metro: tends to write finer as they're Japanese nibs, very hefty and durable (made of brass), have more color options, can be filled with a converter (bottled ink) OR cartridge, it's a bit smaller, it's a snap cap (whereas the twsbi is a twist cap), and also looks dope.

That's just off the top of me head but in depth reviews can be found online. 

Good luck!"
127,ENFP,observer,"Is your left tine busted or is it the photo? When I spring a nib I usually overlap then underlap (is that a word?) The two tines till they finally decide to meet in the middle (gently tho). Worked for my steel nibs, haven't tried on a gold. Live Falcon, liiiiiiive!"
128,ENFP,observer,I would use a loupe to be sure the tines aren't too tight. That caused the stinginess in the flow of some of my pens. Open them up just a tiny bit and it should be Gucci. Wouldn't hurt to check the alignment of the tines either
129,ENFP,observer,Oooh Benu. How's the nib on that pen? Looks so pretty omg.
130,ENFP,observer,"Good choice, though you may inevitably get both at some point :p. Note if you like to change inks often the pilot may be a better fit cause of the smaller ink capacity."
131,ENFP,observer,"i like to find pens that fit best for certain situations like best portability (vanishing point, to me), best ink capacity with no burping (opus 88, to me) finest nib point that i would like, italic/stubs, and etc. wishing you the best in your journey!"
132,ENFP,observer,"I saw the Momento Zero and they're sexy af but as stated in the comments, weirdly overpriced for an eh steel nib (eh from what i've heard). if you wanna go for flashy i'd go for the leo if you want a gold (smoother?) nib go for the 3776. note that the 3776 doesn't come with a converter... from what i remember. if you post pics of the leo if you get that one that'd be cool of you too \*w\*"
133,ENFP,observer,The biggest issue I had with flow issues with any pen is the mudda fuggin converter. Check to see if the ink FREELY FLOWS as you tilt it. If it just stays in place like it doesn't believe in gravity then that's your problemo.
134,ENFP,observer,Oo yeeeez. If I get one I'm totally pairing it up with noodler's uv ink and writing in the dark lol
135,ENFP,observer,"Right? I made just nib wasn't clogged with dry ink, tines are perfect and ink supply is fine... I hope to get another like this lol"
136,INFP,decider,Am I the only one who feels bad for the person that has to clean this up?
137,INFP,decider,"I fucking hate that ""It's a fantasy story. Nothing has to make sense"" excuse so much. Yes, it absolutely does have to make sense. Just because there are dragons and giants in a story doesn't mean that we can have yogurt rule the world and see trees fly in the air. How do people still not get that?"
138,INFP,decider,"Question; wouldn't it be easier for Blizzard to give a timer for when the event ends? It seems like that would save a lot of problem for a lot of people.

(i'm super thankful that the event is back tho. I almost missed out on the most important skin)"
139,INFP,decider,It's honestly disgusting to me how much sex trafficking takes place. And the fact that they only served 8 months in prison? Ridiculous.. 
140,INFP,decider,But aren't you hyped to play Lucioball again for the 8th time? :P
141,INFP,decider,"I shouldn't be surprised that she lied, cause we are talking about Sombra. But I still am. "
142,INFP,decider,"Also the fact that if he stops calling her ""Dear"" and ""Sweetie"" it will sabotage their friendship. That alone just sounds very weird to me. That and that he stayed over at another girl's house without letting know his girlfriend🤔"
143,INFP,decider,"I wouldn't worry about it at all. I am raised by my mom to always be prepared for anything. When she and my dad divorced she had no money for a house and the three of us; my mom, my brother and I had to sleep in a tiny room together at my aunts place for months. I am going to be living together with my boyfriend for 3 months in America over 6 months and I have a secret stash too. I love him and I am sure everything will be okay, but I am just being cautious, for if something goes wrong. "
144,INFP,decider,"Actually, with her trying to stop him and him not stopping, this is abuse AND rape. The moment someone doesn't give consent anymore and you keep having sex with them you are raping them."
145,INFP,decider,"I feel like a second game with Max and Chloe would be boring. I love the first game and I like their story, but what would the second game even be about? Max and Chloe cooking and doing house chores? Them getting into silly time travel shenanigans? Their story is over. It would just be cheap imo to just write some nonsense about them. "
146,INFP,decider,They better do something nice for him next season :(
147,INFP,decider,"Communication is the key! If she has more experience, see this as a bonus, and don’t be afraid to ask her what she likes even while doing it. Plus, guiding someone isn’t awkward, it can actually be really fun. Don’t be afraid, have fun when you feel ready and yeah, c o m m u n i c a t i o n"
148,INFP,decider,This made my vagina retract inwards
149,INFP,decider,"As a gay woman myself I’d say just tell them ""hey man look, I know this is something that sometimes upsets gay people but trust me, I’m not assuming you’re attracted to me. I just wanna get the message across that we are, and will only ever be, friends. I’m saying that because I had past experience with gay friends who didn’t respect my boundaries. Just so we’re fixed.""

And if they don’t respect your boundaries after you’ve said that, they’re just assholes and you can shoo them out of your life. 
Honesty and making things clear right of the bat is often the best way ;)"

169,INFP,decider,"Before this tape dropped, I was really lacking confidence. I felt like I wasn't ever going to be good enough as a rapper. Even when listening to my older work was hard to do, because all I could hear were the flaws. But this tape gave me the courage to keep going. Countless hours spent writing and recording (hell, some times i'd even spend 20 minutes just to say 2 lines, so they would sound the way i wanted them too). This month long process eventually lead to the completion of this project. And for once, I can not only acknowledge my growth, but i can sit back and relax to my own music. I'm beyond happy that i can share this feeling with you all, especially on a subject matter that is so important to me. Not only do I hope that this tape can bring closure and good music for us all, but can do justice for the culture of hip hop. Props to all the LGBTQIA independent artist out there\~"

Death is terrifying for everyone involved, including the one experiencing it and everyone around them. Ursus was no doubt scared, but the love you guys showed him throughout his life and especially in his last moments made him feel safe entering the unknown. He's watching over you now and protecting you guys. Your bond will never be broken. This is such a heart-wrenching story, and I can't imagine experiencing it, but you guys are amazing dog parents.

183,ENFP,observer,"I've always had an interest in astrology, even as a child. Never really resonated with horoscopes, but I did normally feel connected to the different personality descriptions. Bought a book in college that bascially went in-depth on the different personalities of each sun sign, and even my friends thought the book was scary accurate. But it wasn't until an old co-worker of mine made the whole office look up their natal charts that I really, truly believed in how planet placements made you who you are in this life, and how the movements of these planets affect us in a daily basis. That report read me for filth. LOL!!"
184,ENFP,observer,"One thing I've learned from my interactions with my INTJ friend is that this type has no problems with brutal honesty, either on the giving or the receiving end.

Find old hobbies, old music, old books to ground yourself.

Journaling  thoughts may help some people keep track of how they get to this state of mind."

275,INFJ,observer,"Intuition to me is a method of approaching information. It involves a hands off observational approach that analyzes the info, comparing and tying together bits of the info until it forms a big picture grasp of what is happening. It is very fast about building a framework to then expand upon or strengthen when given new information. 

Sensors in contrast are more likely to take little bits of information and slowly piece them together to form the whole theory, and so are not as quick at times to observe the big picture understanding, but are more methodical in approach.

I guess to make a metaphor for it, sensors prefer building up the house one brick at a time, starting from the ground and methodically working up. Intuitives ignore the bricks at first and build a scaffold or frame that outlines the house before filling it in as the bricks come, often in no particular order."
276,INFJ,observer,"Lol, the extrovert thing cracks me up every time. ENFPs are probably more likely to identify with being a social ambivert or even introvert, Ne isn't really an interpersonal or social function in the same way Se is, so that stereotype is more likely to fit ESFPs if anything. 

I'm an INFJ, so I was actually curious about your experience with Ne dominant in relationships... Obviously it is unhealthy and immature behavior to only use one function for decision making, but it does make sense that Ne might be constantly on the lookout for new greater possibilities. Is this still a thought in your head that pops up from time to time or does Fi auxillary imbuing a strong personal value on the other outweigh it?"
277,INFJ,observer,"Yay! This is awesome, I'm super thrilled to see someone making this happen, thanks! I would do something similar to help provide an alternative to the dumpster fire that is r/INFJ, but some friends have already convinced me to make a typology discord server which is enough on my plate in terms of internet moderation for me.

Looking forward to reading and hopefully contributing to some real typology discussions!

Hope you don't mind having an INFJ in the mix 🙂"
278,INFJ,observer,"He has done a fair amount of good in bringing newer people more in depth into typology, but I think he oversimplifies some things and over complicates others. His function descriptions are pretty narrow in focus and while they generally aren't flat out wrong, they miss the majority of what the function actually does. For example, Si being about ""receiving experience"" is only one small aspect of Si that isn't even always true and depends on the particular user in how they have learned to use their functions based on nurture.

As for other aspects of him, his discord channel is a disaster. Many people are finding that the moderator team directly under CSJ are constantly banning people for daring to disagree with aspects of his theory as though his word is the end all be all of psychology. I was personally banned for simply being apart of a different server made with the intent of allowing free speech to talk about his theory or others without worry of being banned.

Upon speaking with many people coming from different perspectives and different theories, CSJ's theory in all honesty is beginning to look like a sloppy hodgepodge of random bits of tons of other theories (very little original work) while mostly failing to acknowledge what comes from what. I have no issues with him borrowing content from other theories, but do so honestly and give some friggin credit where credit is due! It also seems that some of his actual original work is imo over exaggerated and mostly impractical. When being told by some of his personal favorite expert typists that I can't possibly have any good childhood memories because I have Si demon, I can't help but think he has taken some parts too far.

That all being said, I will admit that it was CSJ that spiked my curiosity to start digging deep into Jungian typology and without him, I may not have continued on towards studying source material and learning a lot more about it."
279,INFJ,observer,"This is the main method I am trying to master right now, but I'm curious if you have any sources to go to for how a cognitive axis shows up practically. I've watched some of Michael Pierce's stuff, great descriptions, but it is a little theoretical for practical typing."
280,INFJ,observer,">I believe that anyone with a ""strong"" personality is more dysfunctional than someone who seemingly comes off as unable to be typed. Ultimately, we're aiming to ""lose"" our personalities.

Would you rather be a master of none but somewhat proficient at many things or be the best at one thing? I would prefer to specialize because there are plenty of people who can do a lot of things fairly well, but there is a very big need of those who are *really* good at one thing. I would definitely say I have a strong personality and I am proud of it, because it makes me unique. If everyone was the same bland personality, then there wouldn't be a need to work together as everyone would be capable of doing the same thing. Realizing what you are good at and focusing on that gives you the ability to do that one thing far better than anyone else possibly could, which then combined with finding those who can cover your blindsides means that we can progress far more effectively as a species as all sides are covered.

I would agree that if you find yourself described completely by the ID of your type, then that probably means you are underdeveloped, which is where socionics comes in. A mature person will be harder to type as they have integrated their subconscious and unconscious sides of the mind, but these are used to amplify and cover some of the blindsides of the ego. It is also important to develop these different sides as it gives you the ability to ""interface"" with other types that you wouldn't normally be very good at communicating with, giving us even more ability to work together and increase our efficiency of problem solving.

So I guess after all that rambling, to some extent I would agree in that we need to be well rounded, but we should also acknowledge our strengths and hone it to a razor edge. Being well rounded gives us the ability to work more efficiently with others who have a different specialty, but you will *never* be as good as someone of the opposite type at their specialty, so don't pretend like you can. Be good enough at what they do to be able to appreciate their strengths, but also be humble enough to realize they are better at it and refer to them for their specialty."
281,INFJ,observer,"I don't think the socionics take on compatible types is very accurate. ESTP and socionics' INFJ? seriously? They just tend to get on my nerves. I find we have very little in common and value very different things.

I would claim that a types shadow or unconscious is a better pairing than what socionics claims, so INFJ-ENFP seems to work out really well in my experience at least."

283,INFJ,observer,"Hm... I would disagree. What is boringness anyways? I would call it a perception of something you are very used to that you see as ""common"" or part of the ordinary.

She has the claim of kinship to her father.

Cersei has an extremely tenuous claim at best. She is the wife of the last king whom she murdered and cheated on, bearing children of incest to her brother. How can you say that claim is even *less* than Dany's? 

> we can't pretend as though Dany would just leave if it was revealed Cersei was a good person

This is probably true, but it doesn't change the fact that Dany has a stronger claim than Cersei.

It always dumbfounds me when Americans thinks stating the population of a country somehow negates any possibility for systemic reform. Norway has about the same population as Colorado, would it be impossible to copy the system on the state level? Of course it would. But this population incompatibility line is just that – a line.

There is of course also the fact that the US is obviously richer than Norway, but for some reason you lot seem to think that every member of society has to have a higher average income to somehow be worthy of rehabilitation of something.

It's not for a lack of possibility that that system couldn't work in the US, it's a lack of will.

As a corollary to this, I think it is an interesting possibility that it was some form rapture that did indeed quite visibly discriminate between good Christians and sinners and non-believers. Mallory's sister reacts with terror and deep sorrow to the angels, taking her life with remorse. John Malkovich's wife sees her departed mother and steps calmly into a burning car.

The issue is that Transcaucasian region, which is where we are, is a weird one - it does not 'obviously' fir into either the Middle East or Europe. Again, my personal experience is that people in the rest of Europe tend to consider Armenia and to a lesser extent Georgia as non-European when they see those countries on the map but after going there or talking to Armenians/Georgians they change their minds.

In terms of phenotype Armenians are also highly diverse - my mother is usually confused with North Eastern European, with my dad most people think he is a Jew from Israel while my brother is usually considered French (and we all come from Armenia). This is coming from just one family but there are many people who could easily be confused with Indians or Western Europeans."
398,INTP,decider,We need to develop a decent export infrastructure. Have often heard from businesses in Armenia that they are simply not able to export while Armenian market is too small.
399,INTP,decider,"Europe has too much mess going on as it to provide an meaningful security assistance to Armenia, China is engaged in the region in primarily diplomatic terms but there is no reason to believe that they would agree to open a military base. I understand the desire to move Armenia to Europe but practically Europe (sadly) neither wants nor is able to do anything for Armenia. Meanwhile moving away from Russia can be really dangerous ...  What we need to do is stop looking for someone to protect us and establish strong military with advanced technologies. Given that we have a developing IT sector and a government that seems to want reforms this is very much possible."
400,INTP,decider,"Honestly, having been to weddings I am surprised people hear rabiz. And yes, I do mean ""hear"" because they usually put the music so loud that I'm surprised our population isn't deaf yet (same goes to restaurants).    


P.S. the only way to play rabiz on my wedding would be over my dead body. Like my 4-year old cousin says ""ռաբիզից դեպրեսիա է սկսվում"". Cant comment on mugham as I do not know what it is."

439,INFP,decider,I'm under fifteen and a female and I know for sure that I'm not depressed and I don't have depression I've read up on it and I know I don't have it--anxiety on the other hand (social anxiety really) is different and I want to get diagnosed but can't so I end up referring to myself as socially anxious because I literally can't go somewhere without someone else without overanalzying everything (does that make any sense?)
440,INFP,decider,"One of my baby mamas filed a restraining order on me for three years, then sent me a text, then I sent her a text back and then she filed a restraining order on me for another three years."
441,INFP,decider,Being a hermit 24/7 = introvert
442,INFP,decider,"I'd want to get diagnosed but at the same time everything is a trend: OCD, Depression, LGBTQ+, etc. that the people that have it aren't noticed and we can't do anything about it. I literally see people online posting themselves in a t-shirt saying ""Anxiety squad?"" or something. It kinda triggers me even tho it's a meme but like when you really think about, ""Do you even have it?"""
443,INFP,decider,That sounds more like an introvert than social anxiety. I would've already gone to the bathroom if I was there or just already gone home after using the slightest bit of my energy.
444,INFP,decider,I'm an introvert but I have at least one friend in every class except 1st period and we haven't done any group work yet so my socially anxious self hasn't kicked in yet.

448,ENFJ,decider,"Sorry your best friend is moving. Know that, it’s worth grieving but super cool that you recognize the need for a healthy pattern. 
Agree with comment above. Take time to remind yourself what else brings you joy and pursue those! Or even find new ones! Also taking time to get to know others who’ve been around you. As hard as it is increasing distance with those you know deeply, it gives a great chance to get to know others for who’ve been around you too. Don’t be hard on yourself if you can’t find these activities or people quickly. Things take time!"

What’s particularly interesting is that it was put down by communists AND fascists which is strong evidence that decentralization is the biggest possible threat to any central power structure.  I believe 1936 Catalonia is the example you are looking for.

Orwell covered this subject extensively in his book Homage To Catalonia, but there is a lot of additional material.  The workers literally walked away from capitalism, took over the industries and land, and began massive reforms.  Objectively measured, the experiment was a huge success until it was put down by force."

466,INTP,decider,"I also have very limited dating experience but I am genetically bad at talking to girls.  

It starts with the approach.  Are you awkward?  Cause if so this part can be tough.  I practiced on some less attractive girls—just a little “small talk” (the hardest thing in the world for me; I’m a lone wolf philosopher/historian/scientist type who seldom discusses day-to-day concerns).  I had to read guides on how to do this.  Essentially my method is to find a light topic that’s relevant to the situation and somewhat humorous, get them smiling, smile back, and find a slightly clever way of asking for their phone number.

I’ll usually call within 1-3 days (still not sure how this part works).  And I’ll talk to them for a few days or weeks and usually get ghosted, or I’ll lose interest.  Ghosting is rampant nowadays, and it’s a similar feeling to being dumped for no good reason.  Although I admit it is hard to tell someone that you don’t want to continue dating because of their hygienic issues, or smells, etc. a conversation is still the proper way to handle it.

Dating in the modern era is extremely challenging for me because I can’t read the feelings.  I can tell when they’re losing interest but I can’t fix it.  I think my problem is that I’m not showing enough emotion.  But that is how I am wired, very emotionless, and apparently I’m also wired to think most girls are boring after a few weeks.

Try to strike up a conversation and see if it leads to any sort of spark or feels like there could be a vibe or connection, then ask for their phone number.  From there, it really just depends on the situation I guess.  Try to read what’s going on and be as funny as possible.  Avoid heavy pet names and lovey dovey stuff until it’s time. Make all jokes that come to your mind.   If they don’t like your humor it wouldn’t work anyway.  Coming on too fast OR too slow can be an issue; depends on the girl and the situation.  Don’t be a real liar, but don’t be afraid to feed them a line of hilarious BS about your past, job etc.  these are great chances to make jokes while being mysterious.  Find out what works for you and practice that.

The best advice is to “just be yourself,” even though it seems platitudinous (if not impossible) it is truly the correct aspiration.  The other best advice is to get out there and try, over and over, and be undeterred by rejection and failure, yet another impossibility but your goal nonetheless.  Be polite to them but not a pushover.  Get em laughing and make them feel comfortable with you, but not “too” comfortable.  Play your strengths: I found mine is “mysterious.”  I don’t give real answers to their questions, which means they can’t build a real profile of me.  However after time this works against me because I am cold and do not really desire closeness, just company.  It’s a crazy world out there full of crazy people but there’s a lot of “good crazy” ones, much fun to be had, and a life to be lived to the fullest, and I wouldn’t take back any of these flings or failed relationships because they made me cooler.  Good luck!"
467,ENTP,observer,"Ye but that’s because you understand the different personalities and are altering your answers, it’s not like if you were truly answering for yourself you’d get multiple different personalities"
468,ENTP,observer,"Ok I totally see your points 
And I can recognize that there IS vagueness 
Yet there’s also very specific traits 
EG 
- ENTJs take on the role of managing in groups 
INTPs have trouble managing groups
- ENTPs like to debate 
INFJs do not like conflict 
These are polar opposites so if an ENTP was to read an INFJ description it wouldn’t fit them"
469,ENTP,observer,"“Your first three points make essentialy the same point. Any common like or dislike can form a bond, or a sense of belonging and identity. The question to ask is, is that sense meaningful when it comes to bonding over a common Myers-Briggs personality type? It's not obvious to me that it is so. Could you please elaborate?”

my original three points were just one broken down
Basically I was outlining 
A) you feel part of community (point 1)  
B) this community has people similar to you (point 3) 
C) being in this community give you a stronger understanding and self awareness (point 2) 
So, yes they are related but I wouldn’t say they are the same...

I think the sense of identity and community is actually really meaningful. 
The identity comes back to validating your strengths and weaknesses, making you feel like you aren’t alone in your weaknesses and that your strengths are meaningful.
Not only do these online communities often give really solid advice, but they give validation for deep insights and your opinions (In contrast to other social media forms, targeted at the same audience, which are often centered around your looks or your privileges (EG going on Holidays, going to fancy restraunts etc) )

“ I don't get this at all. Please explain. If one needs to read up on personality types to empathize and communicate with others, pretty much the most basic of skills for living in society, then one has not been adequately socialized.”

Firstly, believe it or not, there are people out there who aren’t adequately socialized and maybe being able to understand for example; why they are quieter, why people jump from one idea to the next, why some people don’t reason well with logic etc.... might actually be helpful. 

That’s all I can type for now.. ifk maybe I skipped over some of your arguments but basically those were the ones that’s stood out to me"
470,ENTP,observer,"Ok that’s an interesting perspective 
I can totally understand that 
I was presuming it would be used to look introspectively but i didn’t think of the possibly that it could be used to stereotype those around you in a work place"
471,ENTP,observer,"I don’t believe in astrology, personally, just cause my sign is not me at all. But if it does offer those factors, then I’m chill with it."

Is it not the only one with so many communities and threads?"
473,ENTP,observer,"Ye ok but everyone keeps on saying that you can get into any category you want to but none are like better then others, so what would be your motive for wanting to do this?"
474,ENTP,observer,I AM NOT saying MBTI is 100% accurate and that’s there’s not better versions. I’m just saying it’s always positive (for the reason stated above!)
475,ENTP,observer,"Do you not think that it is a much less bias system than using gender, ethnicity, race etc. to profile people into jobs? (That’s ultimately what companies do if they have to blindly sort a pile of applicants into jobs) 
Like most people tend to find the personality they get to be quite accurate. 
Also if you keep on getting different answers I would recommend to get a friend to take it for  you as maybe your self awareness isn’t extremely high"
476,ENTP,observer,"UGH, why can’t people understand
I literally said I didn’t think MBTI was fully accurate!
I’m not looking for anyone to point out why it is or isn’t better than other personality tests. 
I just want to know if there’s any negative effects to taking an interest in MBTI"
477,INTJ,observer,"I recently met with a Christian friend and we had an in-depth conversation. It was good. But at the end of it all, they said, ""I am just so sorry that you didn't know the true gospel.""

478,INTJ,observer,I think it can CAUSE mental illness....
479,INTJ,observer,"This is horrible. :( I had to do the same thing when I was 18. 

It's heartbreaking."
480,INTJ,observer,"Actually, I need to come back to this and vent. 

It is true that the lgbt+ community are at risk of mental illness and conditions, and it's not uncommon for someone in the community to suffer from mild to severe mental issues. 

But chicken before the egg here. Seriously. Being told you are born incorrectly from early childhood, being ridiculed by peers and parents and role models at impressionable ages, guilt-tripped into religious practices and being forced to conform to an idea that is unnatural to you, in very much the same way left handed people were forced to conform to writing with their 'proper' hand. Having insults, death threats, and discriminatory words and actions done against you weighs on your happiness. 

The risk of losing loved ones and family and jobs and financial security if you love or live with someone who brings you happiness is, in itself, a great cause of sadness and anxiety. 

In a compounding effect, rejection, trauma and the combination of social determinants all come together to make life fucking difficult for someone in the lgbt community, and that's in a country that doesn't stone them, kill them, or imprison them. 

Ergh. My blood boils.

Edit: spelling"
481,INTJ,observer,"Yeah I see what you're saying. 

Good points. 

>If you don't have absolute control over something, you should be indifferent to it.

If you stay with her for the sole reason because you are afraid to not find anyone else it is no reason why the sex doesnt  work  between you two.

You should  be aware that sex is part of communication. If you two connect on an emotional level  and communicate  in a healthy way usually the sex is good as well.  
How the sex life is is usually  an indicator for how well you communicate. 

Break up with her if you just stay with her for not being single. Thats hella respectless. And it sounds like you would  ditch her as soon as you find  someone else. Thats how cheating happens.  

Second: yes the pill can influence the libido. You can read up the side effects of the pill. They are pretty scary and i made experience with  that as well so i can confirm."

Also i wouldnt  fuzz over something  like that. Try to keep your thoughts elsewhere and be with friends and loved ones. Off from social media gurl! Wont do you any good now."
518,ENFP,observer,He looks so happy and proud its actually funny again 😂 bet he is a huge troll
519,ENFP,observer,"I think as long as she openly posts them and not only to a certain guy in pm it is not morally wrong. As you said it is hers to decide to post pictures of her body and if it makes her happy it isnt wrong. And she even tags you in the photos to show that you are her boyfriend.  
You should keep that in mind.

If it furthermore stays a conflict it would be good to reevaluate if you two and your morals are compatible and talk with  her  about it and if there is no compromising for the two of you it would be time to part."

I took a year off from my studies and the ambitions I had about being perfect in my career disappeared and I have a more balanced look on the future. When you’re in medicine or residency it seems like it’s the entire world and it’s a rat race between people who often want to be the most successful for the success’ sake and not because they think they will be happy. It’s them that will be coming home to an empty house or to a cold marriage. When you build a social circle outside of medicine you will notice that your “status” is solely based on whether you’re a good person/friend or not and your priorities will straighten up.

546,ISFP,decider,"Tbh after being Gold for two seasons I started noticing that I actually DO have an impact on the game outcome. After I started recording my games it's much more clear how I can ""carry"" by making less mistakes regardless of champ. And those mistakes are really small and still make a great impact.

Some of the winnable games I technically throw with one small mistake and then there are games you indeed have no influence on - people who throw/leave 'cause you lose point A or a couple of disorganized people not playing as a team at once. And then there are games you get carried even though you play terribly.

This all leads to ups and downs in your SR and eventually you come back to your initial rank again."
547,ISFP,decider,"Pretty sweet art style, looks quite ominous. Loving the texture of the wavy parts.

+follow on your dA, glad I came across it, loving it. :>"
548,ISFP,decider,"^ This advice. Likewise, some people in game are close to throwing (low elo btw) when they see someone on the team playing a hero that usually should get countered by something the other team is playing but the team might be actually losing because of someone's regular but badly played hero (or other things like not grouping up and people trickling in all the time).

I think knowing when swapping to a ""counter"" is no longer a thing is an experience thing. When you actually focus on a handful of heroes so well that you know swapping to a counter wouldn't solve anything as the hero would be played under your regular skill. But for someone who's getting regular practice in flexing many, many heroes, swapping actually will likely work (assuming there's no other issue with their general gameplay style)."
549,ISFP,decider,"I am going to pick on some things that might or might not be a part of the issue

* You rely _entirely_ on someone's else's opinion (and on top of it, one person only) instead of making your own (that's not a problem in itself if you might be blind to certain facts)

* You have a negative attitude: ""I'm not the greatest looking guy he ever met"" = you translate it into ""told me I look ugly"", not being the prettiest person doesn't have to do with being really ugly

* Has he objectively stated what's the problem? Everyone has good and bad parts (looks) and sometimes all it takes is to lift up the positives to hide/balance the negatives.

* Don't base your value (or whatever you want to call it) purely based off your looks. They matter more in certain fields (modeling, ...) and less in others (jobs to do with other skills and to real friends).

I believe you feel so down about being told this because you maybe based your whole identity around your looks? (I could be wrong though.) It's important to maintain development in many various life areas that grant you confidence in yourself so when you don't experience ""heights"" in one, you won't go the depressive route because you still get to appreciate yourself for many other things - think of them as having crutches to hold onto."
550,ISFP,decider,I didn't know for a long time (lvl 500 ;-; ) that you can see your own team's ult statuses on the stats screen (when you tab).
551,ISFP,decider,"The way I see Ana right now (with the dive heroes) is that the moment someone focuses you, you can't heal that effectively or might die even easier (vs. more than one) than other healers, because their escape kit is just so much better.

Secondly, people are no longer used to how to position with an Ana on your team properly (which makes it hard for you to stay in a safe spot). They just want a pocket Mercy. (*Sigh.*)

I'm an Ana main but I had to drop playing her for comp almost altogether 'cause I feel that even if I make almost no mistakes and try my best, the impact unlike other healers I have on fight is minimal. (I pick her nowadays only against a problematic Mei or a Hog tho for the anti-heal, makes them swap off quite fast.)"
552,ISFP,decider,"Could be, I think it's often the flying Mercy (or other support) I try to bubble during those critical ults (which don't provide for being at a good angle sadly as lots of stuff is already happening)"
553,ISFP,decider,"I'll add some things that might be hard to respond to (as a /F sometimes feeling overwhelmed with msgs):

* (legit happened a couple of times) ""I didn't read your whole post but I think we'd be great friends"" :D

* (optional) mentioning interests but not being specific (naturally you get responses from ppl who have same interests as you, and you may get many msgs that seem looking almost identical for this reason - meaning, who's gonna be the one getting a response? The one bringing up specific topics to attention. - But yeah it's not a rule, sometimes I just prefer answering to a brief msg because it doesn't let me overthink things, you kinda just let the things play out.)

* people who msg might not have mutual goal for friendship or the goal might be unclear (saying ""you're just bored"" when the post is asking for a close friend, time schedule/demands might not match, ...)

* (potentially negative) way too long msgs (think past half the page up to entire screen you view on your 24"" FHD monitor)

* **Also for what helps;** big one - giving a rough draft of what are you up to / going through in the life right now (both positive or negative) usually gives me a fine opportunity to relate or ""see"" the person behind the text

Also honestly I don't know about the deal with bad msgs, I feel like large majority of what I ever get on these subreddits are pretty fine responses (open, personal, friendly)."

She became extremely paranoid thinking that Ursa was behind every little casual mistake and was somehow contacting team avatar to oppress her.

She most likely developed paranoid schizophrenia. It did appear to be much less severe in the later comics however.
565,INTP,decider,"I think people believe this because Chrollo took on not only one, but 2 Zoldycks.

570,INFJ,observer,"YTA.

There seem to be several issues at play here that are frustrating you. 

1. Your parents perceived poor money management skills. 
2. They are not using your gift in the way that you approve (spending on floors vs vacation)
3. They don't seem to be as poor as you thought, ie., They are not suffering sufficiently and you feel your good intentions have been taken advantage of. 

My thoughts are:
1. This is a separate topic independent of your gift and should be addressed separately. There also seems to be some resentment from your teens about your parents not being professionally successful. 
2. Are you giving them a gift, no strings attached, or is money a means of controlling them? You value vacations, but maybe they value floors more because they have to see and use them everyday. Do you only offer them your support (via money, in this case) if they live in accordance how you think they should live?
3. This is a tricky area as it's hard for anyone to judge how much is ""enough"" for someone else -- do they have enough money/stuff, are they suffering enough to warrant assistance etc. I personally think it's a bit high handed to dictate to someone else what ""enough"" is.  

Given the limited picture we have of their finances, it does seem like a poor idea to leverage their residence for a non-neccessity while they are on a fixed income. If you are estranged from them, what good does that do anyone?

In the future, if you want to attach strings to your gift, maybe you can offer to pay for their plane tickets or something like that, rather than giving cash. 

I'm also curious to know how they supported you in your struggles with substance abuse. Was it conditional or unconditional? Was it ""we're not going to give OP money because he's going to spend it on [substance], and we don't approve of that""?"

Many 9-yos are mature and well-behaved. Whose interest were you acting in? Maybe you thought by being a dutiful stasi you could earn your boss' trust and favor.

I think the fairest to everyone would be to separate the online, free translation, and the published, commercial one, as someone mentioned the fact that it's unfair for the professionals translators.

So we could do some kind of cooperative translation for reddit (using a software like the one the teams of subtitlers use), and put it under a Creative Commons license (that forbids commercial use, if I'm not wrong).  

This way it stays a volunteer work, with no money involved for the translators nor for you (you wouldn't be allowed to sell books out of this translation.) 

  
But when you want to do it for a commercial use, to publish the books in other languages (and that'd be great for you!!), you can hire a professional translator, he/she will do a new translation that can be commercialized.   


I think it's a fair compromise for everyone - for the professionals, for us, and for you :)"

Plus the addiction isnt only physical,  it's also the gesture, the body sensations, the social context, etc. So it makes sense that you ""miss"" this feeling - although it's probably your brain tricking you.
There are some plants that can be smoked, totally nicotine free (and not drugs ;) ). Like one mix is called green mango. 
Maybe you can try roll it and smokebit and see how this feels. 
For me, it really felt like shit, only gave me a sore throat and a ciggie craving.

You are having a good approach at this moment, as far as I can see, that is allowing yourself to think about this stuff and being right and truth with your feelings.

Let the 'coming out' part to your future self as you somehow work around it at your own time.

Give it time and it will become clearer as long as you keep being right with yourself.

Don't let anyone tell you different. If, because of this environment, you come across with lots of negativity, you will have to learn to make yourself strong and, if you can, take distance, even if it's just mental distance (if physical diatance is not an option) from it.

You have to know that you are not alone. Behind you is something bigger, much bigger than ourselves. 
We have to look at the past conquests from great people that made where we are today a reality. Conquests that cost some sweat, tears, blood, and even lives.

Their fight is our fight.
And you, being truth to yourself, is enough to honor it.

Let the coming out part come along, at your time, if you choose that path.
I wish you a very happy life."
652,INFP,decider,"They never talk about money, at least not in the same way others do. Like the way people who are naturally pretty never bang on about their looks or the benefits it affords them. It's kind of... distasteful to bring up money in everyday company.

I had a really rich, daughter-of-an-oil-tycoon-rich roommate at university, and when I'd casually mention the cost of something she'd look thrown off or surprised. She never bought things in advance to offset the cost like train or flight tickets, she'd literally show up and buy it on the day. Her family used to do their weekly grocery shop in fucking Harrods. Lol. I remember her buying some bresaola beef and casually mentioning she picked it up at Harrods. Blew my mind. She was super generous too, don't know if they're all like that, but a lot of flashy people are stingy when it comes down to it- the big spending only applies to themselves. I grew up dirt poor, so was always conscious about how much she was spending, which caused us to drift apart because I'd get weird about her paying for things even though it wasn't a big deal for her."

I mean, how much do you really care when you see people with braces? 

The first tray is the hardest. It's the biggest adjustment. It's very uncomfortable. I suffered buyers remorse. I realised I have almost 3 years of this. Then I remembered, I spent 29 years never smiling or taking pictures. After 3 years that will be different. I remembered I saved in order to be able to afford this. I remembered the pain means things are happening. The attachments mean they are moving more efficiently and I'll get the smile I want. You'll be okay. It will be worth it."

I know they take some specialist subjects, but that’s just the equivalent of A Levels in Mugglespeak (or junior/senior high school). Do all professions offer “on the job” training like Aurors? Essentially apprenticeships? That’s progressive, I suppose. Questions I want the answers to, but don’t necessarily need."

When playing roadhog, sometimes the fear of being hooked can deter a tracer, ive had games where I stick with my healers and save my hook for the tracer because I know she'll strike when its down.

Okay so this is My POV: I work too, come home tired too. But when I get home I clean and cook - which also tires me out, when I'm already tired and would rather be in a bubble bath or binging Netflix. So when I am doing all of these things and see that my husband has been sitting on the couch, I get a little peeved because it doesnt seem fair.


To be honest, it really even irritates me that I have to ask all the time (i.e.""nag""). It doesnt seem  very loving to watch someone you care about exhaust themselves while your feet are up. 

So I get annoyed and ask him to do something or remind him of what needs to be done that he can help with. IF he ignores/dismisses me, I go full on nag mode with irritation on the side. 


TL:DR  - The intention is not to complain, it is to beg desperately for some support and help with the overwhelming amount of tasks that need to be done in the house. Tbh, on my end could likely be communicated better than only nagging."

It's important that you understand that if ignore it and pretend nothing happened, and he did try to be skeevy, he will learn that it's okay to cross boundaries. You can say it light hearted too. ""Hey I know you were sleeping and you probably didnt notice, but your hand kinda was touching my butt and it made me uncomfortable.""
His reaction will say alot about his intention, and at the very least you will send him the signal that you noticed, you are not okay with it, and you will not be quiet about it. 
I'm really hoping he gets embarrassed and apologizes and doesnt make you feel that way again, that would be a good sign."
805,ENFP,observer,I would confront it and tell him he did that and it made me feel uncomfortable. It sounds like it could be either way. Any history of him ever making you feel sexualized or uncomfortable before?

812,INFP,decider,"INFP Five with Four wing here. It sounds so easy when I write it like that but figuring it out took me the better part of three years. Granted a lot of that time was used figuring out the systems, but still, soul searching is hard and seeing your motivations clearly is harder. What really helped me was time, sitting with the definitions floating in my head while observing how I really am in the day to day. 

Here's something I found useful. In the Enneagram there are three centers of intelligence: Thinking, Feeling, and Doing. Fours and Fives both repress the Doing center but in their own way. Fours feel. Then they have thoughts about their feelings. Then they have feelings about their thoughts about their feelings. And so on and so on and they never get around to doing anything. Fives think. Then they have feelings about their thoughts. Then they have thoughts about the feelings about their thoughts. And so on and so on and they never get around to doing anything. So what resinates with you more? Do you have thoughts about how you feel (Four) or do you have emotions about your thoughts and theories (Five)?

Hope that helps. Good luck to you."
813,INFP,decider,"(Human variant with Magic Initiate: Wizard: Find Familiar, Prestidigitation, and another utility cantrip that doesn’t require a good Int. Maybe dancing lights or light to get around not having dark vision. Sage background.)

All his life he trained to be a wizard. Perhaps it was a family obligation. Though he diligently applied himself to his studies, arcane magic came very slow to him, and every lesson was an effort. Often he’d catch himself starring out the window, day dreaming about a bigger, more beautiful world. A place that was more alive than the dead books he had to read and the ridged theories he had to understand. To get a leg up on his classes he would spend long hours in the library, pouring over old tomes, and it was there that he first started learning about the druids. There were only hints at first. Odd references in texts about feral magic users in dark forests who were neither disciples of the arcane nor of a powerful deity. What little lore he could find was in a strange language, so to learn more he taught himself to read druidic. Soon he fell in love with the druids paradoxical philosophy.  Both live and let live, and kill or be killed. He began skipping classes, learning the ways of nature through experimentation in the forests near the school. This nature magic came easy to him, and soon he found himself wielding powerful magics. Finally one day, when the ridged reasoning of wizards was just too much to take for another moment he walked away, leaving his possessions and his former life behind. He is now wandering the wilderness. Perhaps he is transfixed by the wanderlust that was stifled for so long. Maybe he is in search of a real life druid to teach him more. Or maybe he is letting nature be his only teacher, following the ways of the druids all on his own. 

Mechanically, find familiar and being a druid lets you cure wounds etc from a distance, as well as scout and use for cool role play stuff. You Could wild shape and communicate with the familiar I believe. In fact you might get away with using Raven’s mimicry to talk to some extent through your familiar while you’re wild shaped. Fun stuff. Good luck."
814,INFP,decider,"I grew up in the Eastern Orthodox Church where fasting is a very common practice. I added it up once, and taking into account Lent, and Advent, and all the special fast days, and the weekly fasts on Wednesdays and Fridays an observing Orthodox Christian is fasting for about half of the year. Also, unlike in the Catholic Church (at least as I understand it, I am not Catholic so can speak with very little authority about their practices) normal Orthodox Christians in the United States really do observe the fast as part of their day to day life. This may be because many of the Orthodox Christians in the United States are converts, leaving more liberal churches in search of a more conservative theological tradition.

Anyway, In this tradition fasting means removing specific things from the diet and the more strict you want to be and more things you remove. The least strict fast is abstaining from meat. Next one would give up dairy. Then fish. Then wine and oil. Finally the most strict fast would be abstaining from all food and only drinking water. This water only fast happens very rarely for non-monastics. Basically only in preparation for the Eucharist and maybe on Holy Saturday. Mostly we fast from meat, dairy, fish, wine, and oil. This is the kind of fast that is practiced every Wednesday and Friday, for the 40+ days of lent and holy week, for the 40 or so days of advent, and for numerous other times throughout the year. There are also practices of skipping meals. Perhaps only eating a single meal at night.

That's the ""What we do"" of fasting, but not the ""Why."" Fasting really isn't about food. It is about quieting your life so that you can pay attention to God. Another way to put it is, we eat less so we can pray more. Especially with preparation for the Eucharist and during Lent, fasting also means a sort of minimalism. It means turning the radio off in the car and turning the TV off at home. It often means abstaining from sex. It means quieting your environment from needless noise and activity and looking for stillness.

One thing to note: Fasting Orthodox Christians don't refrain from eating and doing these things because they are bad. You don't fast from meat because meat is bad. A married couple during Lent does not abstain from sex because sex is bad. You don't drive to work in silence because music is bad. These things are all good. But when we fast they are often needless complications that get in the way of quieting your life to better hear/know God.

One other thing, I have heard many a priest speak words of caution about mixing up dieting and fasting. It confuses the point of what you are doing and why. Fasting is sort of the bodily version of praying, and no I can't explain that any better. You can also make fasting into a false idol. If Lent is only about getting rid of certain things, and look how much of a good christian you are, then you're better off eating a big mac and starting over.

That is a very short overview of the Orthodox Tradition of Fating. If you are really interested in this I would recommend getting more information. The best thing you could do would be to go find an Orthodox Priest and ask you questions. Here in the USA there is usually a church pretty close. Greek, Russian, OCA, Antiochian, doesn't really matter. You don't have to be Orthodox to ask questions. Another option (Though really, go talk to a priest or two) is podcasts and internet videos. Anything by Father Thomas Hopko is Awesome (RIP). In fact here is a vid/podcast by Hopko: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgWh8C7ezNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgWh8C7ezNE).

Hope that helps. Good luck to you.

&#x200B;

Edit: forgot some stuff

I am heavily into keto, intermittent fasting, and more recently the carnivore diet. I am not currently a practicing Orthodox as I have been flirting with skepticism for many years, but I still love many of the practices of the church. Anyway, my current views on nutrition and health at this point are so different from before that now, if I were to return to the church, I would not be able to, in good conscious, follow the fast as it is prescribed. Meat I think is necessary for humans, and replacing it with lentils and rice, at least today, in our food soaked modern lives, is not in my view a healthy or life giving change. If I start fasting again I will likely just fast completely from food, have only one meal a day, and/or eat only fish. 

I wanted to add this because I said rather flippantly said that fasting and dieting is ill advised. I do think this is true, but there is a difference between dieting out of vanity and taking up a Way of Eating that can save your life. If fasting is about ANYTHING it is about how the physical influences the spiritual. If you are fasting from food to get rid of obesity or diabetes, to treat cancer or epilepsy, or anything like that, and you are looking for a prayer practice to support you along the way, that sounds like an excellent idea. 

Second, in the Orthodox Church (as with Dr Fung) fasting is followed by feasting. Feasting is just as important as fasting, just as Doing a thing is as important as Preparation. For example, the 40+ days of lent in the Orthodox Church is followed by Pascha (easter sunday) where we have a giant feast. The week after Pascha, fasting is forbidden. In fact the 40 or so days after Pascha is generally considered a time of Feasting. Just wanted to make that point. There is no fasting without Feasting, and vice versa. Cheers."

816,INFP,decider,"Five wing Four here. I did a short stint with a therapist and looking back I wish I had been less strategic. I approached the therapy sessions thinking that the therapist was the expert in her field and that I should let her direct the sessions.  Like I was a broken computer and I wanted her to see how I was broken without my input biasing her one way or another. I think that was wrong headed.  I'd let her ask questions and I would answer them logically and to the best of my ability, but I could still always hide there. I could hide in what was NOT asked. I could hide behind logical answers. In the end I didn't get a lot out of it. If I were to do it again I'd try to be radically honest about how I felt rather than exhaustively rational about what I thought. I'd try to focus on what is true for me and my experience, rather than on what is true in objective reality.

850,ENTP,observer,"I'm in that same spot.

Your opinions and values are the ones with backing- there are still rules about what to say and do, but people are refusing to learn them. This is because the same systems of oppression that keep non-dominant groups from having equal opportunity are working to keep the dominant groups from seeing the need to change. Hyper-individualistic, non-structural understandings of racism and oppression are a direct result of systemic racism. Individual people who advocate for minorities are not in any way marginalizing those minorities (at least, not most of the time; there can definitely be individuals who do so poorly but I believe this would be very uncommon).

When we as social workers fight oppression, we are not saying ""you are incapable of success"" but instead that there are barriers in place that the dominant groups simply do not have. It's a sociological fact, but one that directly contradicts the common worldview in which individuals are responsible for themselves and that no other factors matter except in extreme cases, and sadly research has shown that such worldviews are extremely resistant to change.

You're doing good work. Your opinions and values (while certainly not perfect and likely to change slightly over time, because that's what happens to everyone) matter and have an impact."

The function overviews are more general but the function analysis articles and typing dilemma articles give examples.

Like... For instance, there's this one: http://www.practicaltyping.com/2018/09/10/11-differences-between-te-and-ti-users/"
897,ISTP,decider,"I personally find the dichotomies limited.. The functions are more accurate. I'm saying that cause as a sensor, I'm not at all into details like sensors supposed should be. The details is Si users or the SJs specifically. Routine is also Si. And I need to understand why I'm doing something before I do it, but that's my Ni. Knowing alot of random information is Ne/Si while jumping to conclusions is Ni. Being skeptical is frequently a T thing not an intuition thing.. Alot of things are attributed to intuition that should not be, which is why everyone wants to be an intuitive and sensors are viewed as dumb. What two types are you struggling between?"
898,ISTP,decider,">Why not? I have issues with almost any SJ I met and with 100% of ESTJs I met. I insult because I just wanted to do it. What's the problem? ESTJs feel free to do it whenever they want too. And they do it almost all the time. They're conflictive and aggressive.

Quite frankly, this sounds like a personal problem. I have worked and interacted with all 16 types, and I can usually get along on a basic level with just about everyone. Do I always like them? No. Do I hate them? No. I have a good relationship with my INFP sister (who is supposed to be the type in most conflict with me), my ENFP brother, my ISTP mother, and my ENTP father. I have good relationship with my in-laws (INFJ, ISFJ, INTJ, ISFP). I'm happily married to an ISTJ, who was my best friend for ten years prior to marriage. I have worked with ESFPs, ENFJs, INTPs, INTJs, and etc, plus several SJ types, including an ISTJs, ESFJs, and ESTJs. Did they irritate me at times? Sure. Did I hate them? Once again, no. I respected their ability to do their jobs well. We clashed at times, sure, and I know I irritated them on several occasions, but that's life. I still respected their ability to do their job, and saw their value in the workplace. Honestly, the type the I've probably legit fought with the most would be my ENTP boss. I didn't like him, and he didn't like me, and we both knew it, but that wasn't a matter of his MBTI type. If you're failing to get along with every SJ type that you come across, then I recommend you seriously start putting some work into your character."

903,ISTP,decider,"Well...I'm not sure how bad your insomnia is.. But for me, at one point as a teenager it just kinda clicked in my head that I'd survived with it up until then. Even though I'd go somewhere and lay awake nearly all night, I could always function the next day. It put things in perspective for me and I just stopped worrying about it. If I slept, I slept. If I didnt, I didnt. I'd managed so far so there was no real reason to stress about it and I didn't want it to get in the way of experiencing life. "
904,ISTP,decider,"Tons of ideas constantly and weird questions all point to Ne. Manipulating people sounds tertiary Fe, and the anti-authority sounds stereotypical high Ti. Wanting people to like you even if you don't like them also hints at Fe.

907,ENFP,observer,"In New Zealand I can go to a counsellor for therapy sessions for basically free. 
If I had any other illness, I would go get it treated. Health insurance wouldn’t be a problem..

Tf is wrong with America"
908,ENFP,observer,Oh my god hahahahaha. I literally rewind my daydream to experience the good part again
909,ENFP,observer,Never seen this before.. super interesting though!
910,ENFP,observer,"Barbell Hip thrusts! 
Squats and deadlifts are great, but nothing burns your ass and gives you booty gains like hip thrusts do."
911,ENFP,observer,"You’re only 16. Enjoy your youth and don’t worry about your future yet. 

I studied Vet Nursing right after high school and my depression and anxiety got in the way of me succeeding. 
Went on a gap year, travelled, learned so much more about myself, pushed myself out of my comfort zone and grew as a person.

  Now 3 years later I am redoing my course. My anxiety and depression have improved so much and I know it’s what I want, and that I am capable. 

Don’t feel pressured to study right after school. Experience life and get to know yourself.. everything else will fall into place. Forcing yourself into study when you are mentally unwell is a mistake.

I can’t completely relate to you, as I’m from New Zealand and know American schooling is so much more pressuring than it is here, and you probably feel like you have to have everything sorted.
But it’s just not true, and you have so much time. 
Just do your best, don’t wear yourself out, and believe in yourself. 

You don’t have to go to college right after high school. Also, for the record.. there’s plenty of animal care jobs that are less stressful to get into. 
I’m a Vet Nurse (tech) and it’s so much fun!"
912,ENFP,observer,Am a 4 and relate to this hahaha
913,ENFP,observer,"When I was a student observing at a clinic, they had a cat in for a spay/abortion as owners thought she was pregnant.
Vet couldn’t find the ovaries after searching for quite a while..
Turns out the cat was a male."
914,ENFP,observer,"More people = more jobs, more funding, more opportunities. 
The difference is priorities."
915,ENFP,observer,"I’ve never understood this either. Wish is so hard to navigate and they scam you with shipping prices. 
Aliexpress is so much easier to use, has better reviews on products, cheaper and normally free shipping."
916,ENFP,observer,I think you’re ENFP. I’m xNFP and relate to much of this. :)
917,ENFP,observer,Would you want painkillers if you had just been cut open? Personally I would
