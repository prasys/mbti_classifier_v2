1,ashleypro321,ipad,INFJ,"Should I go for a 64gb or 256gb iPad Air 2019? Will be using it for school, drawing, and gaming. I have an iCloud storage plan but will probably be downloading a lot of apps. I also want it to last me 3-4 years."
2,ashleypro321,ipad,INFJ,"I mean, there's nothing you can do. Apps nowadays don't support that iPad model or the version of iOS it is running most likely"
3,ashleypro321,relationship_advice,INFJ,I have also never understood this.
4,ashleypro321,ipad,INFJ,"Unless your iPad has become unbearably slow or you are looking for apple pencil support, I don‚Äôt see any reason to upgrade."
5,ashleypro321,ipad,INFJ,Yeah I have the iPad Air and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it if you‚Äôre concerned about longevity. The screen is much nicer too because it‚Äôs laminated (I‚Äôm assuming since the iPad 7 didn‚Äôt say anything about a laminated screen it doesn‚Äôt have one.)
6,ashleypro321,ipad,INFJ,I got the new iPad Air for school and I love it. You don't really need the Pro unless you are looking to use it as a laptop replacement.
7,ashleypro321,ipad,INFJ,"I think it is the oldest ipad to be supported by ipad os? you can find this info on apples website. so it should be fine this year, but maybe next year it will become obsolete."
8,ashleypro321,ipad,INFJ,Seeing as how the 7th gen iPad still has the same old A10 chip as the 2018 iPad I'd say the 6th gen. Unless you care about a bigger screen/ smart keyboard.
9,ashleypro321,ipad,INFJ,I don't mind how it feels to write on the screen at all. You get used to it pretty quick

22,Brainhug,minimalism,INFP,"Way to go :) that can be a difficult but helpful step in removing mental clutter.

Personally, I like to come home and put my phone down in its spot and not pick it up until I leave the house again or unless I get a phone call. I consider social media to be part of my ""socializing"" time during the day and home time to be my ""personal"" time where I can focus on hobbies like painting, exercising, reading or writing. "
23,Brainhug,Meditation,INFP,"Haha! I love that :) 
yet it's the volcanoes that also make new land"
24,Brainhug,minimalism,INFP,"This reminds me of the stoic argument to stop reading new books: https://highexistence.com/stop-reading-new-books-seriously/

TLDR: The time we spend thinking about improving can be better spent on actively improving. 

Personally, I think reflection can help us focus our energies and be more productive as long as we actually follow through on our plans."
25,Brainhug,Stoicism,INFP,"Well said. 

When we say something that is in danger of hurting another person's pride, they are generally more likely to get defensive and become less receptive to what we have to say. 

It is much more productive to find a kind way to say what we want them to know that motivates the person to do better, rather than tears them down and risks them furthering negative thought cycles.


As Stoics, I see it as our goal to release our own pride so that we might better understand the truth in what a person says rather than be harmed by the distasteful or unrefined nature in which they communicate."
26,Brainhug,Meditation,INFP,"I think it's so awesome that you were motivated to meditate entirely from your own experience of consciousness and learned the practices by yourself.

I'm not sure if this is the same, but I often call that scary feeling that emerges ""Holy shit moments"". I think I might have been about the same age as you when I first felt mine, although they first emerged for me from the contemplations of infinite time and present-ness. 

I remember asking a family friend about this feeling and she told me that it was my physical body realizing its own mortality. I'm not sure if that is what it is... although there definitely is a feeling of vulnerability in it. 

It's been a regular practice for me to make as much of my waking and now dreaming life have that ""holy shit"" feel to it. Meditation has helped me achieve that and even increase its strength. It's no longer scary. It makes my senses feel enhanced and time seems to pass differently, although I haven't really noticed something trying to communicate with me as you have. I will try to pay more attention, thanks :)"
27,Brainhug,Buddhism,INFP,"What helps for me is remembering that their beliefs give them great joy and that I do not wish to take that away from them.

 Sometimes I replace the words they use with ones that match my own beliefs (such as 'God' with 'Nature' or 'the unknown'). Looking to the intention of what is being said. If it is compassionate, accepting it with gratitude. If it is not, then releasing it and not letting it take hold. If they choose to get angry and upset with me, then I wish them well and hope their karma does not bring them much suffering. "
28,Brainhug,Stoicism,INFP,"For a modern take, I'm currently reading ""the subtle art of not giving a fuck"" by Mark Manson. It's entertaining and offers a practical definition of happiness that I think merits the attention it received. "
29,Brainhug,Meditation,INFP,This is seriously my favorite show :)
30,Brainhug,Meditation,INFP,Yes :) me too! It's been a great tool for my practice
31,Brainhug,Buddhism,INFP,"Look to your mind as if it were a small child. Hold it in your mind's arms and rock it gently.

""No mind, you cannot have that right now... But I love you anyway"""
32,Brainhug,Chakras,INFP,"Keep in mind that the third eye might not open until all the chakras before it are cleared and in balance.

Feeling like you don't have control in your life can indicate imbalances in your root, sacral Chakra and solar plexus. "

55,immvrtxl,LetsNotMeet,INTJ,"MtG!!! Do you play EDH? I love MtG. Also, the grabbing of the wrist gesture is definitely worthy of self defense. If anyone grabs you by the wrist you are in danger.

Scary stuff."
56,immvrtxl,LetsNotMeet,INTJ,"Delete or make your social media as private as you can. My life's been a lot better since deleting Facebook and my insta is private. Don't accept anyone you don't know and tbh, if he's making fake accounts on ig, report them all for abuse/harassment. You shouldn't have to live your life afraid of some creep. It scares me that he's so bold with you. It means if he wanted to, he could enact violence against you. Please try and get a restraining order against him when you can. Get authorities involved. I don't want this to end badly and I'm genuinely concerned for you. I would also recommend carrying mace or bear mace with you home from school so that if he assaults you, you have some form of self defence."
57,immvrtxl,LetsNotMeet,INTJ,"Big yikes. I really hope he lost his job. That is not okay at all to do, especially in a position of a teacher or authority. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. This is why, as a woman, I tend to trust females over males in authority positions. I hate that it has to be like that but I've had past trauma related to the same and it's unfortunate for good and professional males in those positions."
58,immvrtxl,BabyBumps,INTJ,"How can they be so cruel?! A dog pee pad?! For a baby????? Unbelievable. I hope she gets justice, I feel so bad for her and her little boy."
59,immvrtxl,LetsNotMeet,INTJ,"Have you ever looked at local comic book shops? They usually or sometimes have Friday night magic. It's a cool experience and lots of casual or even serious play depending on what you're looking for. It's a lot of fun. 

I mean, assault on a younger male is still to be expected. John Gacey only attacked males. I'd still watch yourself and maybe take some classes on self defense. A creepy old guy ran at my mother and I when we left a Wendy's asking for change and she told me never talk to people that beg like that. It's from growing up in south Chicago. She took a brick to the eye at a gas station once. I wouldn't put anything passed people."

69,Direwolf202,BeAmazed,INTJ,"Normally fluids can be used as an indicator of which way is down. If you tilt a glass of water, the water doesn‚Äôt tilt with the glass. However, here, the pilot did a very particular manoeuvre so that there was a centrifugal force that appeared around the same as gravity on the liquid. 

Centrifugal force is an inertial force (it‚Äôs not an actual force, but it seems like it is). 

When in a car at a constant speed, you won‚Äôt be experienced any force. You are neither accelerating or decelerating in any particular direction. If you go round a corner, however, you will feel a force pushing you opposite to the direction of the turn. This is because your body would, if unimpeded, continue in a straight line. But since you are constrained by the car, you feel a force as if you are being pulled against the turn, while the car counterbalances this. 

The same is happening to the liquid. If the plane disappeared mid turn, leaving just the fluid, it carries on in a straight line. However, the plane is still there, along with the glass. And the pilot has set up his manoeuvre so that the apparent force that the fluid experiences is close to what you experience from gravity. It looks like the liquid isn‚Äôt being affected by the turn."

152,vivvienne,AmItheAsshole,INTJ,"ESH.  Your brother and dad have no place in forcing you to behave but it was wildly disrespectful for you to do what you did.  It's about as inappropriate as hooking up with the bride's mom during the wedding because she's ""single and therefore fair game, amirite???""  Trying to weasel yourself out of the situation on technicalities really highlights that particularly self absorbed part of immature behavior.  You knew it would upset them, you knew what they were asking of you, but you selfishly did it anyway.  If you can't own up to that you're being dishonest with yourself and the people around you.

On the topic of impact, I wholly disagree that it doesn't affect your family.  The top comments responding otherwise sound like inexperienced young people who can't think beyond their personal gain.  The likelihood of you having it work out for the long run with this girl is just not there considering the amount of thought you put into hopping in bed with her.  The risk you took will create a lot of unnecessary awkwardness to groups of people all for the sake of getting your willy wet when there are so many other options to choose from outside of this family.  It's not unheard of for such relations to happen but often the success comes from the lovers taking precautions in regards to the people who may be negatively impacted by the union crumbling.  You could've kept it all discreet between the two of you and not have anyone ever find out in case it goes sour, while coming out to the family if it grew to something serious.  True, she is the one to spill the beans, now the both of you look like idiots.  Your inability to take adequate steps to avoid this unnecessary mess (not even saying you can't have your cake here) shows how little you understand when it comes to the implications of your actions.

Moving forward I hope you think harder about the way you handle your relationship with this girl, and not just rampage through life on the belief that collateral damage doesn't exist or does not matter.

Edit: really did not expect this to blow up as much as it did, thanks for the gold and rip inbox."
153,vivvienne,AmItheAsshole,INTJ,"YTA even after your comments.  What you presented was misleading.  You lived together and he went on vacation for two weeks.  He didn't ghost you while dating until your patience wore out after 2 weeks of limbo.  You knew you were going to have the chance to confront him when he came home.  He was an ass to not contact you during that time but instead of withholding judgement at least until you saw him again you maliciously fucked another man.  Don't try to pretend you didn't know, you knew what you were doing.  You wanted to teach him a lesson.  You didn't truly believe you were broken up because you expected reconciliation after your actions, like he'd throw up his hands and say we need to work hard on this relationship I understand why you'd cheat on me.  You wouldn't have continued living with him if you really believed you were no longer together.

I would've said ESH if your escalation of the situation wasn't so completely out of this world when weighed against his actions.  I could've even said NTA if your expectations didn't completely contradict your actions.

EDIT:

>I did not care. i just wanted him to message me once in a while.

Revenge sex confirmed...and you expected your relationship to work out after that stunt.  Would've been one thing if you were breaking up with him but to use your vagina as a nuclear tool of punishment?  Yeah, you're definitely the asshole here."
154,vivvienne,AmItheAsshole,INTJ,">OP's husband likely sexually assaulted their daughter.

That is actually quite outlandish to the degree of suspecting a dad to be a kidnapper for being out alone with his child.

People want to believe that kids are always innocent and that is just not true.  All it takes is a trauma as simple as a divorce for kids to turn into little shits.  They don't need to be sexually abused to act out this way.  I once dated a guy who was a shithead to his family for exactly this reason, which is no wonder why I left him.  By his own admission he couldn't cope with his parent's divorce and lack of security from moving so often.  Everything else about his upbringing from his parents was normal while he was almost kicked out of school due to his rebellion.  This included the years of therapy he was put through.  My own brother holds extreme resentment against our father because he wasn't the dad my brother wished for, nevermind that the man he talks ill of holds a master's but took on a paper boy route to put food on the table.  He would never raise his voice, or strike us the way our mom did.  We were both raised the same way and yet I was recently contacted by my brother's frustrated friend asking me how I came out of our upbringing well adjusted while my brother treats everyone around him like shit.

OP's husband is a military dad that was not very present in his daughter's life due to his job.  I can believe that is enough to set off the chain reaction of behaviors coming from OP's daughter, especially when she refuses therapy."
155,vivvienne,AmItheAsshole,INTJ,"Seriously, I can't get through a thread in this sub without seeing people looking to insert their wild imagined narratives into op's story.  Let's just ignore any evidence to the contrary, focus on the negatives and extrapolate as much as we can from that in order to feed our self righteous indignation."
156,vivvienne,AmItheAsshole,INTJ,"It goes both ways. If you want choice for women, men get that right as well up to a woman's bodily autonomy.  Your stance would be at least a little bit understandable if you were pro life, but you're on another level with your double standards."

158,vivvienne,AmItheAsshole,INTJ,"Having unresolved issues to deal with does not absolve a person from the shitty actions they inflict on others, much like how having a mental diagnosis does not make someone NTA for emotionally abusing their family and friends.  We can say that bystanders are good people for being understanding and sticking it out, but the daughter is still the asshole in this situation despite any generosity from others."
159,vivvienne,AmItheAsshole,INTJ,"Everything you said would make sense if the relationship was between two reasonable people, to which OP's wife is not.  Instead of making any effort to understand the effect of her actions she throws a tantrum and calls him an asshole.  A reasonable person would say ""I understand I inadvertently hurt you, but I would still like to have my holiday, is there anything else I can do to make this up to you?""  Then saying ""it's okay, we'll just continue on as if nothing happened"" would be an acceptable answer to that.

A tit for tat response is a response to a person who refuses to do the minimum effort of acknowledging, let alone take ownership of their actions.  Tit for tat is not even the correct term for this.  It's holding a person accountable for their decisions.  You'd think OP's wife would understand the importance of following through with their word (especially as an example for her own kids), but thus far she's completely failed in demonstrating this understanding, or any understanding of where she went wrong.  Instead she chooses to dig her heels in, that's hugely concerning.  How is she going to do better in the future if she refuses to see where she is wrong today?  If OP were to ignore this pivotal problem in order to take the high road all he is doing is opening doors to entice his wife into an abusive relationship in which he enables her behavior, reaffirming that consequences do not apply to her."
160,vivvienne,movies,INTJ,"It's because the mother is the one who is being unreasonable, but the son is the one who is expected to apologize while she acts like a baby.  This short is very realistic to Asian culture and the way the hierarchical aspect can get out of hand. The mom looks at her son like he's her doll, not a person with his own wants and needs.  Even as he reaches adulthood he never grows in height so the mom continues to tower over him.  She feels entitled to his privacy, treats it like he's keeping secrets from her.  Then makes food for his sake without asking if he has plans.  The expectation is that she comes before his friends by default.  At the end of the short, the absentee dad's only contribution is to push his kid to go confront his mom to solve the fight.

While it's nice the mom comes to see the error of her ways on her own, the child is the one who comforts their parent.  In abusive households you may as well be telling the victims the abuser is the one who deserves empathy.   A child should not be subjected to becoming the mature adult for their own parents.  

I could never show my mom this film because the only takeaway she'd glean from this is that children should show absolute respect and obedience to their parent's whims well past adulthood and that even Pixar agrees with her."

162,vivvienne,AmItheAsshole,INTJ,"NTA.  In my last long term relationship I dated a guy who treated me like I was his servant.  He'd leave his wrappers all over the place, soda cans, used dishes.  I'd clean the place top to bottom, leave to go visit family for a weekend only to come home and find a pig sty left for me to clean.

So my birthday rolls around and he asked me what I wanted for my day.  I told him I just wanted a whole day where I didn't have to do any of the chores.  By dinner time he had a mental breakdown and asked me to cook.  There was a particular cognitive dissonance with him insisting that what I do is easy even after that day, as if his incapability to do what I do just vanished from his mind, but when I confronted him about it by holding his feet to the fire he'd turn into a petulant child calling me cruel and heartless.

Obviously I left his ass long ago.  Today I'm still the one that prefers my home at a certain level of cleanliness so I'm the one doing most of the chores.  The difference is that my husband will readily help me and pick up the slack when I'm feeling tired.  My saying is always that I do x,y,z because I love my partner, not because it's my job."

I have been in college for 3 years and still stuck in prereqs (I'm currently an engineering major), I have struggled in most of my classes and unfortunately failed a few, and I have had to drop one. 

I keep getting compared to all of my friends from high school. Of the group, I am the only engineering major, but I believe all of us except maybe one is in STEM, so it's also a matter of ""Well, they can pass their classes, why can't you?"" ""Oh, they're working and you're not and you're still unable to pass? Well, then you really must be stupid."" And the worst, ""EVERYONE is doing better than you."" I didn't get accepted to the university most of them went to, so while they did have each other, I moved away 4 hours from home and had to do almost everything on my own, and it was scary at first, but I am thankful for the people I met.

The classes I haven't passed have lowered my confidence considerably, and while I do enjoy what I'm learning, I struggle a lot in exams, and it doesn't help that most prereqs are set as weed-outs making tests the majority of the weight of our grades, and worse when there's 2-3 exams during the semester. I'm on probation and may be forced to change majors, and it's put a serious dent in me. I am at the moment looking for other options and trying to speak to people to see what I could do that could help me lead to engineering in the future if it's not the path for me right now.

This semester I failed one of my classes and when I finally got the courage to tell my dad, he yelled at me and told me it was my fault and that I was stupid, + the other usual insults of how I'm useless and won't get anywhere in life (I didn't know what I made on an exam that was 25% of my grade until after grades posted. I did inform the dean and the assistant and someone else in that department are in touch with me).

What's worse is my brother (16), is picking up on this, and me and my mom are working on trying to get him to understand that accepting responsibility for your actions and apologizing when needed is important and it's not something you can ignore. I can't do much now since I go to school 4 hours from home (I do come back for breaks).

173,Scyph15,AsianParentStories,ISTJ,">But his stubborn ass wants to take the advanced classes because he doesn't want to be with the stupid kids.

This mentality of being stuck with stupid kids really needs to be discussed and this thought process needs to go down the drain. I've seen this in several posts this week and I'm not understanding why a person not taking ap classes = stupid. Some of these kids may have looked into the requirements, knew they couldn't handle the workload and decided not to do it, especially if they are working or struggling in regular level or honors classes (my school district was AP/Honors/regular level in terms of difficulty) If you think about it, that's pretty smart. 
As someone else said, your brother's only doing it to say they're in an AP class and not want to do the work. Also, I agree with everyone who said your parents should let your brother suffer the consequences of not doing the summer homework. Had this been my own brother, I would have said no to helping him (I don't care how much he would have cussed me out for it), and honestly, I don't think either of my parents would have been willing to help. (My APs are a bit more chill and don't want us taking every AP class offered. My cap was 3 + one DC, and the same requirements for my brother, as he is expected to help around the house as well, but if we can't manage our time, that's our problem, not theirs (note: I'm 21(f) and bro's 16))"

2: We‚Äôve incorporated toys. Idk how I survived without vibrators lol. Literally don‚Äôt know. They‚Äôve helped me want to have sex sooooo much more! They make things mutually enjoyable, which is great cuz it‚Äôs hard to get me to orgasm.

3: I made sex a priority. I‚Äôm the ‚Äúlow desire partner‚Äù and only want sex once a week/once a month if left to my own devices. Sex is how my husband says I love you tho so going without it was very damaging to our relationship. I just made the commitment (without being pressured) to try to have sex once a day. I get to pick when I initiate, and if there‚Äôs a time when I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúYou know, I could have sex rn.‚Äù then I go for it. 

4: We didn‚Äôt wait for my vaginismus to be cured to start. The foundation we laid while I had vaginismus is what allows us to have great sex today."
188,takkenne,SkincareAddiction,ENFJ,"One tip: I have recently had EXTREMELY dry skin, and I was layering a ton of moisturizers and it didn‚Äôt matter lol. A few hours later, my skin would be dry again, and by the end of the day, I was flaky and tight.

What FINALLY worked for me: all of your products are amazing, but if you want to improve longevity, consider adding an oil to your routine. Dry skin lacks oil, which causes moisture from your products to evaporate through the day potentially. Patting in 2-4 drops of oil on top of your products as a last step could get rid of any remaining tightness or flakes you might be experiencing. I use Physician‚Äôs Formula Bright Booster oil. It‚Äôs organic, has AMAZING oils in it, it won‚Äôt clog pores, and it‚Äôs saved my skin. It completely absorbs into your skin after 30 min to an hour. It also makes my makeup go on beautifully."

My husband and I have similar backgrounds to you and your wife, but we have sex 1-3 times a week even if we don‚Äôt have penetration. 

Your wife seems to have more issues than just vaginismus. I think you guys might benefit from a sex therapist. If she has no sex drive, there‚Äôs gotta be something you guys can do, a way she can enjoy sex. Has she orgasmed before?

Marriages can‚Äôt survive with zero intimacy. She should be taking your needs into consideration if you‚Äôre taking hers into consideration."

191,takkenne,vaginismus,ENFJ,"Hey, for what it‚Äôs worth, your reaction is totally and completely valid no matter what. I had no sexual trauma‚ÄîI was just terrified of my vagina (and my butthole...and my belly button... lol). When my high school bf tried to grab me down there THROUGH JEANS I about had a panic attack and cried whenever I thought about it. 

I flinched when people went near my vagina‚Äîdoctors, my fiance (now husband). I wanted sex but I was TERRIFIED of down there. It was scary and disgusted me and I hated it. I couldn‚Äôt even FIND my vagina. 

It turned out I needed a hymenectomy, then I had to spend some time just looking at my vagina to desensitize myself because I thought they were so ugly. I tried to ‚Äúexplore‚Äù but it was so disgusting to me to touch the area (even tho I would masturbate through clothes). I‚Äôd feel intense panic and struggle not to cry. I was married and I couldn‚Äôt touch my own vagina lol.

Dilating helped me take control of my vagina and that part of my life. At first, I was so so so scared. But I wanted to be better. If dilators (Or in this case tampons) scare you, then take tiny baby steps. Your first ‚Äúdilating‚Äù session could be pressing the dilator against your inner thigh. Then your vulva. Then near your entrance. Then in it. You could stretch this over weeks, never going further unless you felt you could. If you feel the anxiety, stop. Just keep it right where it is. Get used to it, till something on your inner thigh isn‚Äôt a big deal, till it‚Äôs not a big deal against your vulva, till it‚Äôs not a big deal near your entrance, till it‚Äôs not a big deal to penetrate.

Once I could consistently get a dilator in, some of my panic subsided. And once I was able to go up in sizes consistently, my anxiety evaporated. I knew this part of my body. I understood it. I knew exactly where it was, how to get inside it, and how everything would feel. I could do it in different positions. I could do it whenever I felt like it. I had regained control over my body.

I have no experience with sexual trauma but I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt sell yourself short and trust your feelings, period, because it‚Äôs not exactly a typical thing to imagine it‚Äôs happened to you and to be wrong. And I say take your time and go so slow. If you want to do this, you CAN do this. It might help to visit with a therapist. But I hope my experience might help a little, even if it‚Äôs not quite the same."

I ignored it for years. High school boyfriend tried to go down on me but I felt too panicked and started crying for no apparent reason. It turns out I had a hymen problem (which is why I couldn‚Äôt find the hole, and I had to get surgery) but that‚Äôs not what caused my weird phobia of penetration. My phobia seems to have caused my vaginismus, so when I finally got to penetration after my surgery, it hurt pretty bad. Hopefully that‚Äôs not the case for you. 

What helped me get past it (as I now can have sex): I spent time just looking at my vagina with a mirror. It stopped grossing me out after doing this a lot; it‚Äôs just a vagina. Neutral. Then I laid my hand on my bare vagina/vulva/whatever which I always avoided doing‚Äîand it felt *so wrong* but I kept it there for 60 second intervals. Soon it felt clinical, not a big deal. Then I dilated for the first time when I got my kit, and that was a huge deal. It was so hard the first few times (like, what if I can‚Äôt find the hole? What if it doesn‚Äôt go in?) but after 5-10 times, it felt normal, natural. Soon it was normal and I felt like I had control of the situation, and I was able to get through dilators and have sex. I‚Äôm not 100% there with my vagina‚ÄîI don‚Äôt like fingering myself for instance‚Äîbut I‚Äòm totally fine with a penis and tampons and that‚Äôs all I want lol."

195,takkenne,vaginismus,ENFJ,"I‚Äôd be extremely upset. This whole thing gets me fired up. I‚Äôm cured now, and I just think guys who whine about their partners having vaginismus are being so narrow minded and selfish. How would they feel if sex felt like their skin was being ripped off their penis each and every thrust? How would they feel if sex, even without vaginismus, felt pretty mediocre? Vaginas have the same amount of nerve endings as the back of your hand. So imagine rubbing the back of your hand really fast and that‚Äôs what penetration feels like. Wow, AMAZING... 

Guys get this mindblowing incredible experience with penetration, but 30% of women experience pain during sex. And yet men feel entitled when this isn‚Äôt handed to them on a silver platter?

You‚Äôre a woman who loves him. You‚Äôre so so so much more than your capacity to have ONE type of sex. Don‚Äôt let him forget that. And don‚Äôt let vaginismus keep you guys from exploring and getting creative. We still do stuff we discovered because penetration wasn‚Äôt an option, and it‚Äôs been amazing even now that we can do penetration."

Or as close to real as perceived debt can be. Maybe you could tweak the probability of some computer snafu deleting your account, the government taking action, or a relative decides to give you a load of money, but it's all so very unlikely.

281,RTX2080Ti0,mopeio,ISFJ,"Firstly, those are not dicothomies. There are 8 cognitive functions.

Each type (codes) have its unique cognitive stack.

You just need to know the two functions you use the most. The one you use the most is your dominant, the second one is the supporter or auxiliary.

**COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS**

**Perceiving**

Extroverted Sensing (Se for short) - Focusing on the moment and concrete reality, physical and engaged with senses (not 5, sorry. There are more than 100 senses)

Introverted Sensing (Si) - Comparing present with past, using tried and true or traditional methods, internal senses (hunger, thirst, pain)

Extroverted Intuition (Ne) - Pursuing possibilities that may or may not act on, new ideas and concepts, drawn to theory, innovative and creative/original, idea/theory in breadith

Introverted Intuition (Ni) - Focusing on the meaning, trusting the unconscious information, conclusions come out of nowhere, idea/theory in depth

**Judging**

Extroverted Thinking (Te) - Organizing the outer world, thinking out loud, directing people, efficiency of the systems

Introverted Thinking (Ti) - Thinking inwardly, taking apart systems to analyze in depth, logical decisions

Extroverted Feeling (Fe) - Seeking outer harmony, dislikes conflict, evaluating others' feelings

Introverted Feeling (Fi) - Doing what you want for personal happiness, controlling and engaging with inner emotions

Now find the description you fit the most. This is your dominant function. Then here are some rules to choose your secondary function:

1- The identity (Introverted/Extroverted) must be reversed on the secondary function.

2- The role (Perceiving/Judging) must be different on the secondary function.

This creates 16 types and their most prefered function pairs. The first one is the dominant, the second one is the secondary/supporter/auxiliary.

**TYPES AND ITS FUNCTIONS**

INTJ - Intellectual - Ni Te (Dominant Introverted Intuition, Secondary Extroverted Thinking)

INTP - Inventor - Ti Ne

ENTJ - Leader - Te Ni

ENTP - Originator - Ne Ti

INFJ - Psychic - Ni Fe

INFP - Creative - Fi Ne

ENFJ - Inspirer - Fe Ni

ENFP - Charismatic - Ne Fi

ISTJ - Worker - Si Te

ISTP - Crafter - Ti Se

ESTJ - Boss - Te Si

ESTP - Daredevil - Se Ti

ISFJ - Helper - Si Fe

ISFP - Composer - Fi Se

ESFJ - Counseller - Fe Si

ESFP - Party Animal! - Se Fi

His lack of ambition and total denial of and unwillingness to engage with conflict and the fact that I wasn't happy led me to literally being on the brink of leaving him. We were fighting every day, desperately unhappy.  

When he thought I was leaving him, he cried the first tears I'd ever seen from him-- in over a decade. It was a real wake up call for him. He began to consider his own actions and how terribly uninvolved he had been in my life. 

We've worked hard on our relationship and have gotten things to a better place, but we have kids and so lots of reasons to stay together. If your relationship is worth saving I'd try to see a counselor together to have a safe place to express your needs.

Since you‚Äôre either IxTP or IxTJ, this means you are either a Ti dominant, Si, or Ni.

But I am going with IxTJ because I don‚Äôt see any indication of Ne which could make you appear as scatterbrained or hyper in your thinking. 

Now I am down with either ISTJ or INTJ. You have a lot of Te in you first off. You are someone who prefers an efficient and more organized  approach. 

However, after reading your answer to whenever you daydream or attached to reality. It literally screams Ni to me. So therefore, my answer will be you are an INTJ.

If you are confused or concerned about something, you can ask right away!"
322,Foreign_History,MbtiTypeMe,INFP,"Hi, i'll try my best to type you!

>I just want to be happy, have fulfilling and loving relationships, be able to show the real ""naked"" me to the people I care about and them accepting me the way I am, I accepting them for who they are, even if it would be hard. I just want authenticity and mutual love and respect. Professionally, I want to earn enough to help support my loved ones, while also help people through work, whether it may be in a non-profit, consulting, government etc.

*That's the most Fi thing I ever heard it's not even funny..* You value authenticity and individuality. Fi doms are all about knowing their personal values. They are also the ones to usually help those they feel are undeserved in any way. Fi types may not be the best at expressing, but they find many ways to do it such as drawing, sports, dancing, creating, etc. 

>I like writing for self-expression, liberation of thoughts.  
I love movies just for the art of cinema, the characters, their stories, lives, love, adventure, lessons, All of it intrigues me,  
I enjoy going for walks and to the gym simply for the alone time, some thinking time, freedom from the day. 

More Fi üëÄ

>It's only important if expectations aren't being met, I guess. I do have trouble being efficient though.

Inferior Te. You show it when you 500% have to or is under stress. Expectations that aren't being met would stress out most people, but for Fi doms they would use Te for the sake of being efficient when there's no other choice.

I am going to say ISFP! I say this because you are a lot more physical oriented (Gym and other physical activities). I do notice more Se than Ne from you. I do take it you like to do activities that requires physical effort (correct me if I am wrong though lmao).

448,moonlightwhispering,socialwork,ENFP,Can you put him on a behavioral contract? I‚Äôve had to do that with several clients (PSH setting) including for theft. Setting really clear expectations and consequences and having regular check-ins.
449,moonlightwhispering,relationship_advice,ENFP,"Ohhhhhh my word dude. I wish my ex boyfriend could see this. He‚Äôd never accuse me of ‚Äúwalls of text‚Äù again. That said, I‚Äôd honestly only send the first paragraph. Let her know you‚Äôre giving her space. And then LET HER come to YOU. You were the dumpee. The dumpee never wins the dumper back by this sort of approach. Your best shot is to actually give her space. She will more than likely eventually reach out. But sending this 10 paragraph message will make her think you‚Äôre more desperate than ever."

Then fully accepting undeniable truths, such as my sexual orientation, and not hiding that truth from family (especially extended, as they learned, mainly through adding me on Facebook) no matter the consequences.

Any strength I needed I found on my own, and through myself. To grow and evolve into who I am today, and to keep improving myself.

That all happened a decade ago. Feels like a long time since.

OP may also think that his history presents his authentic self instead of those questions because he may not be self-aware.

Looking through his comment section is pretty much the same as reading through a chunk of answers to the megathread questions. I think that OP is actually making it easier for you since his thought process and preferences are easily shown through what he does in his history rather than some carefully chosen answers that may or may not show biasedness.

>MAKE you do the whole thing.

If someone's type me post provides less information than OP's history, it's even worse than what you suggested. Over here it's quality over quantity.

I get what you mean, and I'm just trying to say that sometimes the history says much more about a person than their selected information about themselves. Take type me threads as interviews and their history as their informal self. Which do you think portray themselves better? "

He made me a playlist of his favourite songs, and brought me a copy of his favourite book. We swapped real names and talked honestly about life and relationships. One night we met up in a bar and he hung out with my friends, stayed out all night and he crashed at mine. We were together for about two years. I quit sex work and went back to university, got a normal job. We moved in together, my family adored him and I got along really well with his mother. 

We broke up for pretty normal reasons, I wanted a responsible partner who I could build a life with, save money, be fit and healthy. He wanted to tour with the band, drink and party. Last time I saw him he was in and out of rehab and in some volatile relationship. I saw his mother last year and his business had failed, he hadn't been sticking with rehab and he was being charged with assaulting his ex-girlfriend. I really hope he manages to deal with his problems and get clean, I'm still thankful for the time we had and don't hold any grudges.

> **By ALL accounts, *Rhodes did not* inflict any of the mortal wounds upon any of the victims**‚Äîa mitigating circumstance. He did provide the weapons, the gloves and the transportation, with full knowledge of **what *Steven Woods* planned.**

Reddit has good intentions, but both sides of the story have to be heard.

**EDIT:** 

A lot of people keep referring me to Steven's account. Let me ask you this: If (as Steven claims) Marcus Rhodes was really the only one that killed these people, then what was his motive?

The websites above state that Steven had a motive: to kill a drug dealing rival.

Another point: Beth was killed because she witnessed the murder. If Steven truly had no part in the killing (and was as 'shocked' in the car as he says he was), why did Marcus not kill him, too, for being another supposed witness?

One key point is: **Steven ran to a different state (California) after the murders. If you were truly an innocent bystander to a murder (as he claims), why would you run?** Why not report it and immediately exonerate yourself, rather than run and risk blame?"

Other games from the same genre for low-end includes: 
- Titan Quest (get both Immortal Throne + Ragnarok to be good, a bit pricey for what it offers imo)
- Dungeon Siege 2 (runs terribly on win 8 + 10, need lots of tweak to work properly on those 2)

Then I'm pretty sure that if wanted you can get referred from gids to a gids endocrinologist and they sort out hormone blockers and hormone replacement therapy (testosterone) which I don't think takes very long (I haven't got to this point so I'm not really sure but from my understanding this is what happens). You have to be on hormone blockers for a year before you can get hrt and you also have ot be 16.  If you have already been to cahms then it shouldn't be too hard to get reffered to gids but you can also get reffered by your gp I think"

727,Giovana_P,Enneagram,INTP,"For me you seem a lot like a 7. You have way more reasons on 7 then in 9. 

About why you think you may not be a 7, it sounds a lot like 7's virtue, sobriety, when you're mostly satisfied with your life but can still perceive and accept the negative experiences as an important part of it. And your strong mind probably comes from your 8 wing

I actually didn't understand what you said about having something wrong in your mind, but I don't think I'd have much to add on that anyway. 

NOTE: don't take advice only from me, I myself am having issues with finding out my type. I'm just trying to follow the theory I've learned."

732,Giovana_P,Enneagram,INTP,"Yeah, I've been trying to do that, but I found out it's harder that it seems. Also, most of the material on enneagram that you get on internet only looks very superficiously (is this word right?) Into those.

Anyway, I suppose one of my biggest fears is to finish an ""unfulfilled"" life, and unhappy with what I've done with my time. I guess this ressembles more the seven's fear, deprivation, but I'm not sure, because I don't totally understand the meaning that ""deprivation"" has in this case."

734,Giovana_P,Enneagram,INTP,What are your main reasons for considering being each type?
735,Giovana_P,Enneagram,INTP,"I'm still trying to dicover my type, and every time I consider being a 9, one of my reasons for thinking I'm not one is that I repress myself because I fear rejection, not because I seek peace. Now, if what you say is right, that's a small indication that I may be a nine. Of course, given my confusion, I could also be haf the enneagram"
736,Giovana_P,fairytail,INTP,"I honestly didn't think END would be back, but I'm rethinking it, since Natsu looks exactly like that time he fought Gay in Alvarez arc. However, when Lucy rewrited END's book she said something like ""the Natsu we know is no demon"", which seems to mean that she erased the demon part of him. So now I really don't know what is coming, and I'm exited.

About Lucy saying she was afraid of Natsu's flames, she may be right, since those flames came from Ignia, who doesn't seem to mean any good. And, of course, there's the odd possibility of END. Other than that, I think there's no need for her to worry about him, since violent and lacking control is just the way Natsu always fights."

738,themanofmanyways,AskReddit,INTJ,"This is a cultural thing I guess. I'm Yoruba and the only reason I could possibly throw my grand mother out of the house is if living with her is an absolute nightmare. Even if my grandmother had a billion dollar life insurance policy and planned on leaving nothing for me after dying, I wouldn't kick her out of my house or even see that as a reasonable option (I mean, to be honest if I was in dire need for cash and she pulled that, I would be pissed, and the idea would certainly flash through my head more than once, but I wouldn't go through with it or even think it reasonable).

It's less of an ""offence"" and more of, should I say, a ""withholding"" of what most people should give. And while that's a shame, if you aren't taking care of someone to get something then while you might feel hurt (which is perfectly understandable), you shouldn't react that way."

740,themanofmanyways,literature,INTJ,"*The Decameron* by Giovanni Boccaccio.

The stories of first day to the third or so were nice and engaging, and they do a good job of putting the reader in the atmosphere of the Middle Ages. Those of the fourth and some of the fifth, however, were somewhat painful to read. I say painful because while I'm sure the stories were particularly engaging when they were written, the romanticizing of cheating in the name of love put me off immensely. I was practically waiting for the fourth day to end. I think I can understand why affairs are glamorized, however. Unless I'm mistaken, taken from what the book has said so far as well as prior knowledge, arranged marriages were the norm (especially in the upper classes) in those days. Marriages born out of love were a lot rarer than today. Compounding this was the social requirement of marrying a partner befitting one's class. Finally is how women seemed to have little say in who they married. This is just my guess using the little I've picked up from the book as well as general knowledge I'm not sure how I know (it could be TV and a bit of other things I've read for all I know)

Considering how the book is written for women, I suppose it makes a lot of sense that while one can find many instances of women cheating on their husbands, instances of husbands cheating on their wives are nonexistent. At least, so far. Still, I'm only on the sixth day. Let's see what the rest of the story holds."

742,themanofmanyways,noveltranslations,INTJ,"I feel it's the best Er Gen work I've read so far (still ongoing). It's definitely not light in tone like ISSTH or AWE but rather takes place in a grittier, darker cultivation world. It's much closer to Pursuit of the Truth/Beseech the Devil. I found it a little slow in the beginning, but it eventually blows up to become epic from chapter to chapter. Frankly, I think out of all of Er Gen's MCs, Wang Lin (i.e. RI's MC) most deserves the title of heaven defying cultivator."

>But if all you're reading is easily digested fiction (which I'm not disdaining ‚Äî I read genre fiction too on a regular basis), then you really don't have much to congratulate yourself about over someone who just watches films and TV.

847,chanuliw,LoveIslandTV,INFP,"I think most people can understand Amy's emotions. The reason why she's getting so much flak is because of the way she's treating Lucie. It's fine to be insecure, but the problem is that she's resorting to what is arguably bullying to feel more secure when she could be going about it in so many other ways. 

Insecurity is something to be worked on. It's not an excuse for shitty actions"
848,chanuliw,LoveIslandTV,INFP,"I reread The Hunger Games right before this series started and this is definitely a thought I'd been having all summer lol. I'm surprised to hear that other people have been drawing the same comparisons. I think most reality TV shows can be seen as similar to THG, but LI is more similar in that both shows are GIGANTIC in their respective countries.

Amber reminds me of Katniss in the way they both received so much unexpected support and love from the public, but the books mentioned that the public started wearing their hair in Katniss's braid after she won, and it kinda makes me wonder if Molly Mae's bun would've caught on with the public had she won lol"

851,chanuliw,LoveIslandTV,INFP,Yeah... can't imagine how difficult it must've been for her
852,chanuliw,AmItheAsshole,INFP,"NAH. I think you have good intentions, and I understand why you want to have 1 on 1 time with your son. 

Your daughter's young, however, and judging by the fact by what your wife said, it sounds like your daughter feels hurt by your actions and told your mother so. I think most children at this age would feel upset if their father did something like that, and I wouldn't be surprised if she feels or grows up to feel as if you favour her brother. You should try putting away a little more time for just her, imo; I know your family plays games together  frequently, but having 1 on 1 time on the PS4 with your daughter *as well* as with your son may make her feel less excluded, whilst still providing your son with the 1 on 1 time he needs."

874,Ted_the_Teditor,HVAC,INTP,"I'd be willing to bet that's the fan. If the fan has been that bad for a while it might have damaged the motor. Take out the motor, fan and fan housing. If you can put power to the motor by itself. If you still hear the noises. It's definitely the motor or the fan. Take it to your nearest friendly electric motor repair shop to see if they have a replacement. The Fasco motor company makes some replacements. It would depend on the model."
875,Ted_the_Teditor,HVAC,INTP,"A three post cap is always a dual rated cap. Plays the same part that the two you see there in the picture are currently filling. As long as the wiring is correct and there are no dimensional issues there is no practical difference. If you look closely a three post cap is usually marked for condenser and motor side. Sometimes with a c and an m

I work at an electric motor repair shop, so I'd recommend checking on the motor. It should be connected to the 5mf cap"

878,chillthe_f_out,AmItheAsshole,ESTP,NTA - your mother is going batshit crazy.Talk with your father and try to get her to talk with psychiatrist.

881,chillthe_f_out,AmItheAsshole,ESTP,YTA - hope someone kicks you out of that house.Poor  woman gave two of you house so you dont need to pay rent and you kicked her out after her son died.This is probably the biggest d*ck move i have seen here on this sub ever.
882,chillthe_f_out,apple,ESTP,"a little bit off topic, but am i the only one who is really not fond of all this ""voice assistants thing"" including google ,amazon and any other thats gonna eventualy arise"
883,chillthe_f_out,AmItheAsshole,ESTP,NTA - its obvious that it wasnt about making a new friend or looking at your sketch.He came to you just to promote Christian club.Everything else was just badly done intro.
884,chillthe_f_out,formula1,ESTP,That way of thinking is the reason why Merc is at the top all this time.

Someone will put both the dogs outside, and some time later she is inside with no one admitting to having let her in.  Sometimes she'll be outside when no one has let her out.  We have two dogs, and every single time this happens, she'll be alone with the other one outside/inside - and they're normally let out/in together.  No dog doors and we don't leave the doors open without the screens shut.

I don't really think she's teleporting (I hope she's not, the ramifications are terrifying), but I seriously have no rational explanation for it unless someone in the house is developing dementia or amnesia and doesn't like the other dog."

929,BendiganYT,darksouls,INFJ,"Not all humans are victims of the undead curse; there are other kingdoms outside of Lordran where being undead is stigmatized and being fully human is normal. Those without the curse die normally and leave a body behind. That's one theory that explains the bodies. 

Another theory is that when an undead dies, their corpse remains there until they respawn at the last bonfire. While this is highly unlikely, it's still technically possible.

There is a third possibility, though, and it's a much darker one. You know those hollows in that first area of the New Londo Ruins? They're not aggressive, they're sad and afraid. They're also *stationary, never moving even if you hit them*. So it could be that all the ""corpses"" around Lordran are actually hollows that have *completely* broken, so disheartened and miserable and numb that they simply lie there, unmoving, forever. It's the next step after becoming similar to the New Londo hollows. They just don't--or can't--care enough to stop you when you take items off them, so we assume they're corpses and treat them as such. When you think of them that way, the game changes quite a bit, doesn't it?

952,Hiromant,MGTOW,INTJ,"My problem with TRP is, they are all about effort. It's ultimately a list of all the things you need to do to hopefully qualify for female attention. It's no different than the blue pill apart from the items on the list.

It's also a coping mechanism for physically unattractive guys who hope they can lift, work, lie and posture their way into what comes effortlessly for tall, good looking, confident men.

MGTOW is ironically also the optimal ideology for attracting women. Fuck effort, don't give a shit about them. Direct your energy toward obtaining the life you want to live. If any of them like you, your indifference will only make them work harder for your attention. If not, there's not much you could have done about it anyway."

961,an-estj,Enneagram,ESTJ,"For enneagram, the way I see it is looking for the sun that their behavior revolves around. 

For example, I was in school with a 3w4 that I didn‚Äôt like too much. He was pretty highly regarded among most of our peers, but spent an awful lot of time behaving like he was trying to prove something to me or get me to admit his superiority in some area. As someone who generally doesn‚Äôt give a shit if people like them or care about proving myself to someone that clearly doesn‚Äôt want to be around me, my brain flagged this behavior. And when I looked a little deeper (starting paying attention to the language he used with others, the way he would talk about certain things he was good at, how he reacted to praise etc etc), the 3 was the obvious sun that he revolved around. 

In regards to narrowing, I‚Äôd say I rarely immediately know someone‚Äôs full type and enneagram right off the bat. I personally think many enneagrams look similar (3w4 versus 4w3, etc) so generally I narrow it as ‚Äúthey‚Äôre either this or that‚Äù and pay a little closer attention to ultimately identify their core need. 

As a last side note, I‚Äôd say that enneagram (at least to me) feels incomplete without doing the MBTI typing alongside it or before. I think they work best supplementally and fill in each other‚Äôs gaps."

1031,deepBlueCheese,Christian,INTJ,"Scripture seems to have pretty high standards for itself in terms of communicating a lot of content with great brevity.

However, there are a few proverbs which I think are funny in a dry kind of way

""Let your foot be rarely in your neighbor's house, lest he become weary of you and hate you'"" Prov 25:17

Or

 ‚ÄúBad, bad,‚Äù says the buyer, but when he goes away, then he boasts."" Prov 20:14"
1032,deepBlueCheese,Christianity,INTJ,"Good question!

The term actually has different meanings in different places.

In Israel, most believers would call themselves Messianic rather than Christian, as the term is much less loaded with potential negative connotation. This is quite a fair thing to do, esp. as 'Christ' comes from the Greek translation of the word Messiah.

In America there is a strong Messianic movement which is essentially a group of people moving back to the Jewish roots of the faith.

The range here is quite significant. Some people enjoy the odd Jewish feast for fun, and like to learn more about the Old Testament, etc.

On the other hand, you can get people doing things like: calling themselves Jews when they aren't biologically, moving back into legalism, or having a significant superiority complex. There can sometimes be a very painful culture of people being almost bizarrely attached to the minutia of Jewish tradition, even more so than Messianic believers in Israel.

Outside of the States this range exists as well, although there's probably a lower concentration of what you might call 'hard-core' Messianic culture.

Having had a little bit to do with different people in these ranges, I think there's a lot to gain from the understandings of people in the Messianic movement, but also a fair bit of peril in sacrificing the Centrality of Christ on the altar of Jewishness."

I think God uses weaknesses like this in our lives to help us depend on His strength, which isn't something we do by default! Our natural response to our own failures is to just try and come up with clever techniques from our own strength to try harder.
Paul talks about this problem in Romans.

Romans 7:18-19 says:
18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. 19 For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. 

I would really highly recommend that you do a really decent Bible study into Romans to look at this. One great book to explain this topic is called ""Lifetime Guarantee"" by a guy called Bill Gillham.

How does it do that? Unlike bacteria, it has no organelles, or any means of obtaining resources or energy to both create new virus babies. 

A virus (bacteriophage, in this example) will use its attachment 'legs' to grab a bacteria, lower its 'head' into it, and inject its DNA (or RNA) into the bacterial host, where the virus USES the metabolic processes of the bacterial host as well as the DNA/RNA replication, protein synthesis factories to create hundreds of new baby viruses inside the bacterial host. 

After some time, or after a given termination point, the bacterial host basically explodes and releases more viruses that go on to affect other bacteria/hosts.

Imagine a fly that can burrow into your heart, drinks your blood and stores a ton of baby flies that are created using your own bodily proteins and resources and explodes out of your chest killing you, and releasing hundreds of baby flies that look for other people.

Furthermore, her death is important in shaping the story and made Code Geass so powerful in its themes. Lelouch learning that there are consequences for his actions, becoming more determined nonetheless, his turn to Zero Requiem--her death was influential factor in it all.

Boos and likes are relative to one another.

1093,Clarkeste,MarioMaker2,INFP,"The designers did think of this. There is a reason they didn't go with it.

1: Lots of stages in that tab would be impossible

2: Impossible stages would lower player morale, and make them want to go else where

3: Good stage creators play every section of their stage dozens of times before upload. They wanted to make you playtest at least once.

4:  If a creator does not playtest their stage, it's possible that (unintentionally) the stage really is impossible. Your entire description here makes me think you don't playtest actively, which leads me to believe some of your stages, in reality, may be unbeatable, and possibly even unpolished. You can't just force half of the making duty onto someone else.

5: ""Nintendo is stealing form you?"" I'm not sure if I was supposed to, but I find this a little bit funny. It's not Nintendo fault that you play kaizo badly. I don't want to be rude, but that's the truth here, you're making stages that are waaay harder than your skill level, then blaming Nintendo when you can't beat them.

6: You payed 100$ dollars for the game? Did it go out of sale at your shop or something?

7: (not exact quote) ""I feel like Nintendo is stealing the core game from me (level creation and upload)""
There are so many things wrong with  this sentence. First of all, they're not stealing anything. Not everyone can have the same skill as big time streamers. If anything, your skill stole it away from you‚Äîand I get it! I also suck at kaizo and can't upload kaizo. That's not Nintendo's fault, though. That's because I suck at the game. 
How are they stealing level creation? You can still make the levels, can't you?

1155,Oudynfury,AskReddit,INFP,"Let's be honest. The internet has seven sins, not seven wonders. I'll assign some across the top of my head.

In no particular order.

* Reddit is Lust, a highly addictive and indulgent platform that tempts users with knowledge and ruins their lives with memes.
* TVTropes is Sloth, due to its uncanny ability to drain one's time.
* Snapchat is Pride, due to the frivolous self-indulgence it represents by its very existence.
* Instagram is Envy, due to the vanity and vote obsession it creates, often breeding rivals from friends.
* Facebook is Wrath, a volatile platform that stands both as a useful tool for expression and a means of aggressive self-destruction.
* Buzzfeed is Greed, a modern sensationalist news platform that profits off of misinforming and wasting the time of the lowest common denominator.
* 4chan is Gluttony, a growling beast that devours all mercy and innocence that dare approach it."
1156,Oudynfury,Fantasy,INFP,"Dune might well be my favourite book of all time; it's certainly one of them, at least. The level of thematic and philosophical depth contained within the story is honestly mind-boggling and the world-building is second to none. While it's not without its flaws, the lack of relatable characters and stilted dialogue coming to mind, Dune is undeniably a masterwork of literature.

The sequels are excellent too, in a slightly different way. Dune itself is an incredible stand-alone, and perhaps the best story in the series, but the sequels through God-Emperor at least expand on its philosophical depth to an enormous degree. I would recommend them to any reader of the first book who wants to see the story continued or its ideas expanded upon, but would caution that they often completely lack the human element that Dune is already kind of shaky with.

So, yeah. Incredible book, and equally incredible philosophical dissertation. Dune isn't just a novel; it's a feat of storytelling and deserves to be recorded as not just a classic of the genre but a classic of literature, period."

1163,Oudynfury,iamverysmart,INFP,"This was shared by one of my friends and for some reason, I actually decided to dissect it on a logical level. After doing so, I came to the conclusion that you're completely correct. It's utter nonsense, intended to make him seem intelligent when he really, really isn't. 

In my experience, highly intelligent people spend less time asserting their intelligence (unless they're very insecure) and more time trying to teach and learn from other people. They recognize that while they are smart, there are people who are smarter, and even those far less intelligent than them can still teach them things. This guy does not. Instead, he boasts about how much better he is than everyone else in the most pathetic, validation-seeking manner he can."
1164,Oudynfury,wow,INFP,"Having played both WoW and GW2 (albeit the latter in mostly PvP), I agree wholeheartedly. The games are built around fundamentally different philosophies. Guild Wars 2 characters have infinitely more tools available to them than WoW characters when it comes to avoiding, ignoring and cheesing mechanics. GW2 also allows players to be a lot more self sufficient; in WoW, players are dependent upon each other for survival while in GW2, the action combat and self-healing systems allow players to take care of themselves in many circumstances.

Another critical point is that of the downed state; in GW2, players don't immediately die upon reaching zero hit points and in fact cannot be instantly killed by any source whatsoever (though there may be some boss mechanics that subvert this). While brilliant design from a PvP perspective, the existence of the downed state makes failure a lot more forgiving. Rather than a limited number of combat resurrections spread across a large group, GW2 allows for liberal combat rezzes in most situations.

When it comes down to it, WoW is more forceful and less forgiving when it comes to encounter and character design. WoW players have a consistent and limited set of resources available to them in any given situation, and bosses are designed around this fact. Not just limited on a per-player basis but on a raid-wide one. Take Bloodlust, for example, a buff given out by Shamans (well, and some others). It's extremely powerful, but when received, it puts a debuff on players that prevents them from receiving Bloodlust again for a period that is far longer than the duration of the spell. Take all the Shamans you like, you're not getting more Bloodlust.

Blizzard understands exactly what your characters are capable of doing, and because of the way WoW works, you're playing on their terms. If they want a mechanic to be impossible to ignore, it will be, because no well-timed dodge can save you from a nuclear explosion. Well, maybe if you're a rogue with Cloak of Shadows, but you can't build a raid out of rogues. If a boss requires a tank-swap because of a stacking bleed, that bleed will be incurable. WoW is designed around rigid, hard-set rules. They can be mitigated at times and broken in very specific situations, but they aren't ""soft"" rules like GW2's.

Don't get me wrong, I love GW2. But it's a different game, a more forgiving game. It's a game that gives players agency, allows for significant errors. and presents problems that have more than one solution.

/u/GW2Bergal, [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tbf87mPWuA) are [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38U4RAxhCTE) boss guides that in my mind, exemplify high-end WoW raiding. The first is Mythic Kil'Jaeden, undoubtedly the hardest and least forgiving boss in the current expansion. The second is Heroic Siegecrafter Blackfuse, a boss from two expansions ago who nonetheless demonstrates the extreme degree of mechanical complexity to some WoW bosses. I think these bosses highlight just how important the mechanics are to WoW raid bosses, and how strict they can often be."
1165,Oudynfury,worldbuilding,INFP,"Attempting to usurp the Dreamer, the local creator goddess. It's entirely possible; in fact, Alivus II succeeded in doing so. The ritual isn't even that hard, if you can get your hands on her body and have access to several hundred experienced spellcasters. It's not really a good idea, though. The Dreamer is totally detached from the suffering of humanity; in fact, she'd probably rather us rot away to nothing than anything else. And that's a good thing.

Let's just say there's a reason that the Blood Gods of old forced the Dreamer into a sleeping state, where she can only muster occasional semi-conscious actions. The Dreamer has all the powers of infinity, but none of the omniscience necessary to use it. Because of this, her attempts to create perfection will inevitably fail. So what's the point I'm getting at? As Alivus II found out rather harshly, no mind is capable of comprehending infinity. It doesn't matter what your intentions are; attempting to wield the power of creation will result in catastrophe as you unknowingly break the laws of the universe.

So, yeah. You can absolutely become God. Unfortunately, not even God is smart enough to *be* God, so what makes you think you are? Unless you want to sleep forever, knowing that your dreams and desires will subtly reshape the world around you, but you can never awake to direct them, I do not recommend it. You could become the Devourer instead, and be able to destroy anything. That's a limited infinity, so humans can understand it. Unfortunately, you will be totally isolated, unable to even *speak* properly, left to act as your race's silent and despised protector, just as the Devourer does now. So altogether, becoming a Cosmic Twin? Not recommended. "

1188,Beanbean5916,AskReddit,ENFP,I think it would be a very good idea
1189,Beanbean5916,AskReddit,ENFP,"I've dealt with this a lot over the past year, and I have found a few tools that have greatly benefitted me.   
One is simply using your natural voice. Often, when anxious or pretending, we subconsciously change our voice to fit our facade. Simply focusing on using our natural tone of voice can help us feel more relaxed, independent, and more ourselves.  
The next one is similar. Only act as energetic as you *are*. You DO NOT have to pretend to be excited about everything. You DO NOT have to smile and laugh all the time. Nobody does that naturally. Sometimes I think we mistake the absence of a positive reaction for a sign of inner weakness and turmoil, so we quickly cover it up with a laugh and a smile, and this quickly can become toxic, as maintaining it can be an immense drain on our well being and stamina. To instead focus on reacting naturally and only acting as energetic as we feel, we can regain a lot of confidence, because we can own what's real, not something made up that could crack any second.  
This leads to the final and most important thing, *own the things that make you* ***you.*** As I have observed people, I have noticed the thing that sets apart those who are not themselves and those who are is the fact that they own their qualities, and not in a cheesy, love yourself even if you're awful kind of way. You have to be comfortable enough with who you are to make fun of yourself and laugh the hardest out of all of them. This doesn't mean you have to like everything about yourself, that would be incredibly vain and unhealthy. We all have flaws, and it is healthy to want to solve our issues. But it is important to remember that EVERYONE is dealing with the same stuff. It's nothing new, nothing more horrendous, nothing less solvable than things others have gone through and conquered before you. Once you realize this, it can help to make your tasks a little less daunting, and a little more tame and normal, even funny!

Finally finally finally, accept that you will not be able to do any of this sometimes. There will be times when your brain just won't have any of it. That is the time to cool down, take a break, refresh, and wait for your feelings to pass. The most important thing is to not be mad at yourself for your feelings, let them come and go, and deal with them accordingly when you can. 

You are a beautiful human soul out there in the universe somewhere, and I believe you can do this. Everyone can."

1194,Lord_Ronan,im14andthisisdeep,INTP,"The Joker wanted to prove that him and every other human being are not as different as it would seem and that they were all just one crappy day, one traumatic event from becoming just as evil as him.

He proved this by causing a situation in which he put Harvey Dent and Rachel in two separate areas filled with dynamite and giving Batman time only to save one of them. Batman tries to save Rachel but in a genius move, the Joker switched the addresses of the captives causing Rachel to be the one who dies as Batman can now only save Harvey.

In the aftermath of this event Harvey Dent doesn't only bear physical scars as the explosion caused half of his to blown off, but emotional scars as well due to the fact that he loved Rachel. He then becomes insane turning into the classic villain Two-Face.

This is in the end proves the Jokers point because he managed to prove that through shaking his life up in the just the right way, he was able to turn Harvey from the earnest and goodwill idealist he once was into an evil sociopathic murderer."

1249,Jawub,skyrimmods,INTP,"Another inconsistency (not really the right word for it perhaps) is that Imperials have experience and perk bonuses which are completely useless to npcs. Claw damage on Khajiits is ridiculously strong on Legendary difficulty. Personally I'd like to see Enai bring Morningstar a bit closer to Imperious in some ways, such as changing the racial base stats, but still keep it minimalist.  It gets rid of some inconsistencies like you said, but adds on others in their place, although not as bad.

Just realized I'm talking to you, that's cool. Just want to say huge fan of your work, and don't take my disagreements in design the wrong way. It really just comes down to personal preference, which is why I included both of your race mods in my list.

Edit: I should clarify that Khajiit claws combined with their increased movement speed is overpowered. Not saying you should get rid of either of those but perhaps lowering them wouldn't be a bad idea.

Also I would say that you should keep the spell absorb Bretons have since probably most of the people using Morningstar approach Skyrim modding with a minimalist mindset. That being said I'm unaware of just how many complaints you got for someone else's mistake/decision.  


Edit 2 : I guess the Imperial bonus really isn't bad at all and most of the things about Morningstar are things I like. It's just feels like it so close to my idea of a perfect race mod, but just not quite there yet."

2. The snare can't possibly have too much reverb if I didn't put any reverb on it. If the snare was dropped 3 to 6 dB you wouldn't be able to hear it at all.

3. Where is the mud? What frequency range?

1267,Sherbhy,cscareerquestions,INTP,"I'm also in my 3rd year of college but I'll share stuff what I've searched upon and found useful. Most of them are gonna be specific to engineering.

First decide on what you like, what in CS interests you the most, because you're gonna get a job on a specific role. You can be a fullstack developer as well but being focussed on something specific will make you learn stuff accordingly.

Watch this video to know about the types of engineers in CS:
https://youtu.be/_9ZS6q4996g

After you've decided what you like, learn about that particular thing i.e the different tools and frameworks.

I'm interested in data science so I've been learning stuff like machine learning, data science which involves python, and tools like numpy, scikit learn, Tensorflow etc.
But before learning these frameworks I learnt the basic concept behind machine learning since it involves a lot of math.
Then I started to make small implementations of what I learnt in python. I hope to make bigger stuff during my semester break.

Now since I want to be a data scientist, I don't require proficiency in stuff like java or C#. That's why it's important to chose a track you like.
While developing machine learning projects I need to deploy what I made, so for that I learnt Flask, which is a framework for back end web dev in python. This way I'm learning relevant technologies.

Java is used in a lot of places from back end web dev to android dev. If you want to work on Java, I'd suggest subscribing and following upon related subreddits and youtube channels to know what stuff people work upon in java. Do the same if you decide to work on any other track. Dedicate whatever free time you can give to this. Afterwards try finding an internship or contribute to open source projects and such to showcase your skill level and various tech you know. Cheers!"

The cheating and resulting guilt probably motivated him to do better. Also probably with renewed vigor in the bedroom. I would never recommend cheating but in this scenario it seems to have brought everyone closer together.

99% of the time this is not the case, but in this specific case it seems to have been largely positive.

Humans in history have largely been non monogamous, and the ideas of monogamy have only been practiced for a few hundred years.

Yes it's a social contract between two people that agrees to certain standards, but it's also a human contract. Humans are not perfect but they will often do what they think is right.

1482,bewareofduck,explainlikeimfive,ENTP,"What I have learned in evolutionary psychology classes in favor of light eye color is that it allowed men with light eyes to be reasonably sure of the paternity of their offspring. If a man had light eyes and his mate had light eyes, it could raise questions if their children had dark eyes.  
Also, pupil dilation can be an indicator of sexual interest. It is much easier to distinguish this sign of attraction in those with lighter irises. It is also easier to see increased bloodflow/blushing that can indicate attraction and arousal in lighter-skinned individuals.  
Light skin (like large breasts) is  one of those traits that makes it easier to gauge the age of a potential mate. Without the sun-protective effects of much melanin, light skin shows spots and wrinkles quickly. Likewise, in a time without bras, large breasts that had not started to sag could indicate both fertility and youth.  
Hormonal changes at puberty trigger slight changes in skin color in men and women. Men become slightly darker-skinned, and women slightly lighter. Exaggerating the differences between men and women seems like it has been a tactic to increase attractiveness in many cultures over time."

I wish I would have met him earlier than that, but neither of us were mentally quite ready to conduct a healthy relationship until our mid-30s. Not just that but we both kept being drawn to people who turned out to be wrong for us, maybe subconsciously we didn't think we deserved better, or knew our selves well enough to recognize what was a good fit? I also did the same as you -- took a few years getting to know myself via living alone, understanding my preferences, treating myself well (dating myself too), and honoring my boundaries. I worked on my passion/hobbies/personal goals enough to know it wasn't something I would drop for an SO.

1563,beefthathasredmiddle,AskReddit,ESTP,"I think it more has to do with needs, expectations and willingness to accept change. 

Positive change is very easy to accept. If I won the lottery, awesome I‚Äôm cool with that. Negative change is harder to accept as it threatens our needs and our expectations. 

I think there is a evolutionary tendency for people to be comfortable with a way of life that keeps them alive. We live in a world where our needs to live are easily met. However, any threat to that way of life, misfires that hormonal response to a degree where we feel our world in crumbling down and we need to adapt in order to survive. Even if it would be very easy for us to survive. 

The truth is, the world is a unforgiving place. A lot of people aren‚Äôt willing to accept that. The world wasn‚Äôt made to enjoy, but made to survive and overcome. Negative experiences only bring you closer to that realization. As negative things are only negative if you are unprepared or unable to accept them. 

If you see the world as a fantasy land you‚Äôll live your life forever disappointed, but if you see the world and its potential to be cruel you can prepare and adapt, and that is the only way you can be truly grateful for the positive things that enter your life.

1575,Cawaica,sex,INFP,"Good seduction is all about anticipation and teasing! Having the discipline to make you want more in my opinion! I think women tend to have a bit of an edge in this since a lot of us are conditioned to not be very direct, but everyone can learn! Imply without actually giving it away or being 100% direct, so it engages her mind and she literally can't help but think about it. ""What did that mean?"" Lots of body language. Like I might brush my hand softly on my thigh, so the gaze is just naturally drawn to that area and they start thinking more about it. Deeply inhale and exhale once softly on her ear, so she wonders what it would sound like to hear you panting and moaning softly into it. Give a single, big stretch, showing off your height and size for a second, so she wonders what it might possibly look like to have that looming over her.

Anticipation tends to be the difference between bodies thrown against the wall, hands everywhere, steamy amazing sex, and ""eh."" Food tastes better if you're really hungry for it, right? ;) Foreplay for me is really just finding ways to make your mouth water."
1576,Cawaica,AskReddit,INFP,"This. 

I was giving up a lot, the only one working, they were never happy with anything I did. I found out my ex apparently complained to his ex about me being depressed, told her he kicked me out, among other things, and lied and denied it when I confronted him about it. 

That was when I permanently fell out of love with that person, and realized that I couldn't deny the fact that I was dating a monster any more. Any love, trust,  attraction, loyalty, effort and respect for that person instantly died, and I was so utterly repulsed and disgusted by this person being allowed to be so close to me in my life that I almost literally vomited. He made me sick in every sense of the word. I gave him a chance to show me if there was actually anything in it for me if I stayed. There literally wasn't."

1691,redtrout15,AskReddit,ENTP,"Women would be at too great of an advantage if they were respected as intellectually equal to men. They already have their emotional side much more cared for, have an absurdly easier time making connections, friends and getting relationships. 

Men generally cater to women and their needs and want to suck up to them so there is no way they could achieve intellectual equality or else they'd just dominate everything, there isn't really a middle ground."
1692,redtrout15,runescape,ENTP,"Because many people my age at least have played this game but it was nothing more than a fad for middle schoolers to most people.

1) will be auto include in market assassin 

2) INSANE when comboed with any shouts

3) Can swing you a whole game in a Skeever deck

4) Crazy when comboed with any action that draws you a card

5) Even good synergy with ring of imaginary might / high horathgar decks"
1700,redtrout15,elderscrollslegends,ENTP,"The game is pretty healthy right now. It went through a very dark age for a while where it received no updates for a long time and it was gravely imbalanced but things are looking up again now. We are in one of the healthiest metas I've ever seen and I've been playing this game since beta.

A lot of players are concerned though that DireWolf seems to have little interest in organizing competitive tournaments. Although this game recently recieved an expansion and a small update it is very infrequently updated and can sometimes go months without any new content.

1702,LeanderLema,RoastMe,INFJ,You must be focusing on your non existent successful future
1703,ViolentCaterpillar,beatles,INTJ,"Wow, his profile is instantly recognizable."
1704,ViolentCaterpillar,aspergirls,INTJ,"Wow, that's horrible and I'm sorry to hear it. I wonder if it's at least partly an eye contact issue? (When you applied originally, did you either meet with or video chat with them? If not, then I don't know what to say.) Eye contact is a big part of how NTs assess honesty. That's why being ""shifty-eyed"" is considered to be a bad thing. Body language is important too--slouching is considered bad, for example. Maybe the department head had an especially bad--one even might say prejudicial--reaction to lack of NT levels of eye contact and body language. As far as her saying others agreed with her, I'd take that with a grain of salt, especially if she as department head was imposing her opinions on others and expecting agreement.

Anyway, if this is it, it's possible to train yourself to improve your eye contact and be more aware of your body language. That's pretty much the extent of my thoughts on the matter, I hope it's at least somewhat helpful."
1705,ViolentCaterpillar,beatles,INTJ,"Ok, I'm a huge huge Beatles fan. Love them to bits and have listened their albums into the dust. As a kid, their entire catalogue was sacrosanct and I'd never criticize any of it. Now that I'm an adult, I'm more honest with myself about the songs I don't like as much. One of their popular songs I've never really gotten is ""Michelle."" Not a fan of the words, the badly pronounced French, or even the melody. It's one of the reasons I vastly prefer *Revolver* over *Rubber Soul*."

1707,ViolentCaterpillar,Fleabag,INTJ,"I love Andrew Scott anyway, but his acting in Fleabag has been absolutely miraculous. When he has great chemistry with other actors, like he does with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he's simply magical. This just might be my favourite of his performances. "
1708,ViolentCaterpillar,beatles,INTJ,"Huge Lennon/McCartney fan here, yet I'm going to go with ATMP. ""What Is Life"" is probably my favorite Harrison song out of his entire catalog, so I'd even pick ATMP on the strength of that song alone."
1709,ViolentCaterpillar,aspergirls,INTJ,"Based on what you've said about this departmental head, it sounds like she doesn't have your best interest at heart. Instead of being honest with you, perhaps she was just trying to justify her own prejudice and get you to leave her office. So unless I saw the letter in question, I'd doubt her claims. Is there a way you can get a copy of the letter? If your letter writer actually said that, that's not cool; if she felt that way, she should've been upfront and said she couldn't give a recommendation. At any rate, see if you can get copies of all letters of recommendation before  applying elsewhere. Best wishes, don't let these jerks get you down!"
1710,ViolentCaterpillar,beatles,INTJ,"The Nerk Twins. 

I love, love, love the phenomenal hybrid that is Lennon/McCartney. The musical and personal chemistry between them powered the engine that ran the greatest rock band of all time. Together they were magical. There are things I love about each of them separately, but the reason I love The Beatles so much is because I love them as a pair. The influence they had on each other was incalculably profound: to pick John is to pick someone who was deeply, deeply influenced by Paul, and to pick Paul is to pick someone who was deeply, deeply influenced by John."
1711,ViolentCaterpillar,aspergers,INTJ,"Oh, I hate that question. I never know what people are getting at or why they're asking. Now, instead of answering, when someone asks what I'm doing later, I just ask, ""Why?"" That forces them to get to the point, so I know how to answer. "
1712,ViolentCaterpillar,beatles,INTJ,"Cool, although I think the leap from Rubber Soul to Abbey Road is a bit too far; Rubber Soul directly to Revolver makes more sense."

retarded idea. high doses/repeated use of diphenhydramine has been shown to increase risk of dementia signifigantly, correlation doesn't equal causation etc etc but i wouldn't play around with this shit. dementia is not worth whatever you think the benefits are, and there's much better and safer drugs to use instead. dxm or other dissociatives are well known for anti depressant and introspective effects, and psychedelics also have value as a tool for a sort of 'brain reboot' in the same sense. don't worry about it know but stop doing this shit, benadryl isn't enjoyable, is less effective for entheogenic purposes, and has serious risks."

1725,joeb1kenobi,3Dprinting,ENTP,"This is most accurate depiction of the hobby ever 

Edit: word"
1726,joeb1kenobi,pics,ENTP,"Siiiiiigh. Ok. Here goes.

This is brilliant design. There I said it. And so is the Apple Pencil charging position. Because Apple designs through problems, not around them. 

I use both daily. Most charging configurations (I.e usb cords, docks) assume that during the course of charging you will either have to use the device while charging or putting it down. Why would that assumption be made?

Because of the simple, accepted, familiar fact that CHARGING TAKES A REALLY LONG TIME.

But while everybody else designs around that problem. They accommodate. They compromise. These are the constraints lets make it work.

Apple, on the other hand, takes a different approach. They say ""what is the absolute ideal of this device/experience."" And then work backwards. If you pay close attention to their design decisions you can see evidence of those thoughts.

Example 1. The battery indicator lights in MacBook pros. They disappear when not in use because Jony essentially asked ""what would the ideal be for indicator lights?"" And he decided the answer was ""in dictator lights should only appear when indicating something."" So he spent millions of apples dollars buying and engineering the CNC mills capable of milling those indicator light pipes out of their aluminum frames. Meanwhile, your Lenovo puts plastic lights on the surface that are there all the time. Big deal? Nah. But it's not ideal.

Example 2. This mouse. Prior to this mouse I owned a Logitech wireless mouse that had a charge port on its nose. It would die a few times a week and I plugged it in. So easy and convenient, right? Well, after a while I stopped unplugging it. It quickly became a very expensive wired mouse. Then I got this mouse. Laughed at the stupid port and regretted my decision. But after weeks of using it became clear that Apple made the brilliant decision to, instead of coping out with a shit battery and wired option, put in an amazing fast charge battery and removed the option of you using it tethered. This batter charges so fast that I have literally plugged the mouse in, held it there for a few moments, and then took the cord out and continued using the mouse for the rest of the day. It was a crazy sensation to not even have to take my hands off the device to get enough juice just like that.

This design makes a statement about usability, you can't use it while charging because you DONT HAVE TO. It's a simple and elegant way of informing the behavior of the user. And I love it.

My personal belief is that Apple design has only gotten better. Apple design hasn't died, but it's sales man has. If Steve Jobs was alive I would never had to figure out what was great about the mouse on my own. He would have told me.

EDIT: I'm getting a lot of questions on my thoughts on the headphone jack. Honestly, I was just venting and looking forward to downvoted oblivion. Pleasant surprised that people are reacting positively. 

Guys, phones are really really powerful computers/machines packed into really really small cases. I say also machines because theres actually more moving parts than the average computers. You got all these sophisticated accelerometers, cameras, motors, gps's. All of the worlds most advanced sensors taken and scaled down to miniscule sizes that we all thought impossible just a few years ago. And then... we have the 3.5 mm headphone jack. A behemouth of antique analog technology taking up the equivalent of an entire city block in an over crowded borough. 

We need that space. You think you love the jack, but just try wireless headphones that actually work (I love mine, even though they aren't perfect. They make me really excited for the future). Watch what happens when we get rid of the crutch of wires, and the entire consumer electronic world kicks wireless innovation into the next gear. And watch what phones start doing with that little bit of extra leg room. It's a good move. I'm in favor.

Apple always builds towards the ideal. And Steve Jobs said the ideal was a single pane of glass. Period. A frameless, nearly weightless (just the right amount of weight) display that does nothing to distract the user from the content of the device. They will always work towards that ideal with every iteration. And that means removing things. The three rules of good design is 1) remove 2) remove 3) remove. Remove the redundant, the unnecessary and even the good things. You've got to remove a LOT of good things to make room for the better. That's the hardest part of great design. And Apple actually does it.

 I hope they get rid of the lightening input next."

1731,joeb1kenobi,AdviceAnimals,ENTP,"I regularly work in Apple factories in China. (But never have been to Foxconn. ""Slave-like"" conditions they are not. They are easily the best facilities for miles in any direction. The workers are paid better than their peers, with benefits, work the same hours, and the mood is generally really upbeat even when there are tight deadlines. China, as a country is enjoying a strong surge in their economy and factory workers have a lot of power due to the fact they have plenty of jobs to choose from. So... I don't know where all this is coming from.

I mean, I've never been to Foxconn. But I'm really having a hard time imagining it could be that much worse than their other factories. 

I'd love to talk to someone who has actually been there, understands China, and can really help me understand why Foxconn is so frequently compared to slavery. Anyone?"

Sure ultimately it's her choice to keep the baby, but OP never mentioned any intentions to raise a child. He was against it and he's not able to in the current situation. Why would OP be an asshole for not wanting to be involved in a situation where he made it clear that he didn't want to be involved in? It takes two to tango to raise a baby. A child growing up in a household where the dad didn't want the baby would be absolutely atrocious for the kid.

1777,tacodude64,MovieDetails,INTJ,"Yes, but I‚Äôm more-so talking about the symbolism from 2049. The LAPD mindset is to hunker down and let the dystopian chaos blow over them, which is shown by huge ocean waves crashing on the dam and the heavy rain beating against the windows. These images represent the human instinct to survive in adversity and weather the elements. On the other hand, the pools of water inside Wallace Corp are completely still and we can‚Äôt hear or see any rain. Here we have a mentality that seeks to control and transform the environment- to shape chaotic rain into a still pond. Wallace sees the human gift of reproduction not as a means of survival but as a natural resource that must be dominated. The final fight between Agent K and Luv takes place outside the dam where there is no longer shelter against the elements. It‚Äôs a fight of survivor against controller, but in a stroke of irony, the controller drowns in the uncontrollable forces of the ocean. There is an implied statement that the primitive force of self-preservation is what keeps us human and that the world will drown us in our desire to overpower it.

Edit: I can't take full credit for identifying this symbolism. Here's some watching material if you want other takes on water in BR2049:

1788,sherbearrrx,fasting,INTJ,"This has to do with the body adjusting to a lower intake of energy from food but also not letting insulin fall enough to access fat stores. Let‚Äôs say you eat 3 meals a day with snacks in between, for instance. 

If you lower your calories but you‚Äôre still eating just as often, insulin still goes up each time you eat, however less so if you eat smaller portions and even less if you limit carbs/protein.  If you are eating, you are stimulating insulin, which is the hormone that enables your body to store fat. If you cut calories but still eat often your body will just adjust to the lower calorie intake by lowering your body heat and making you more tired. Eventually you might plateau. 

Fasting, however, keeps your insulin at the lowest levels possible and your body instead runs on its own fat, converting it to ketones for energy.

If you have lots of stored fat, your body recognizes that it now has lots of fuel and burns more energy, raising your metabolism and energy levels. 

Your body also becomes more sensitive to insulin  over time with fasting so you don‚Äôt need to produce as much, which would help keep the weight off easier long term."
1789,sherbearrrx,fasting,INTJ,"Depends on your reason for fasting. Are you fasting for weight loss, for autophagy? If for weight loss only, I‚Äôve read you can eat up to 500 calories a day and still be considered ‚Äúfasting‚Äù. 

People in this sub will say unless you‚Äôve had black tea or coffee, only water is allowed.

If you were not feeling well, you definitely should not continue fasting. There‚Äôs no shame in eating and starting again. Your effort has not been lost."
1790,sherbearrrx,fasting,INTJ,"It‚Äôs safer to break your fast with keto foods, and start out with something very small like a handful of nuts. Wait half an hour or so after eating something small before having a bigger meal."
1791,sherbearrrx,fasting,INTJ,It‚Äôs much better to pause the fast and eat than to risk passing out or worse. 6-7 days is admirable even if you do decide to properly stop the fast now.

1812,NaltaCount,Enneagram,ESTP,"The other two Stooges in my three-piece ensemble are an ENTP 7w6 (?) and an ESFP 3w2. Nowadays, we only really hang out at once during Halloween, since we don‚Äôt really live close together, but Halloween is nuts and shows off the group dynamic pretty well.

I remember we were trick-or-treating at this rich place with a lot of Indian people, and I asked this one lady, ‚ÄúDo you celebrate Halloween in India?‚Äù My 7w6 friend gave me a weird look. Next house had an Indian person, too, and I asked the same question, and he got even more nervous, which kept getting funnier and funnier. The next house had a white person answering the door.

‚ÄúDo they celebrate Halloween in India?‚Äù My 7w6 friend just walked away without a word and we both started bursting out laughing. I did the same thing at 14 consecutive houses and he eventually just put up with it with the most ‚ÄúFucking kill me‚Äù face, although he‚Äôd leave if it was an actual Indian person at the door. I asked him why he was so nervous, given that most of these people were actually Indian, and he just yelled ‚ÄúExactly! That‚Äôs exactly why!‚Äù

As for my 3w2 friend, he‚Äôs the most popular one out of the three of us. Me and my 7w6 the only one of the guys that doesn‚Äôt seem to suck up to him, which I‚Äôve always found funny, since it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs very threatening? Aside from physically being the weakest of of us, he‚Äôs also the most tolerant when it comes to being made fun of. Anyway, he tends to be ‚Äúairheaded charismatic,‚Äù where his attention span wanders while someone‚Äôs talking, and comedy ensures when he gets called out. We were at this one middle-aged woman‚Äôs house, and she starts talking to my 3w2 friend as she‚Äôs giving out candy.

W: ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

3w2: ‚ÄúHm? Oh, hi.‚Äù

W: ‚ÄúI said ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äô‚Äù

3w2: ‚ÄúOh, okay. My name is [name].‚Äù

W: ‚ÄúOh, okay.‚Äù

3w2: ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre good.‚Äù

W: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

My 7w6 friend started cracking up at the fact that they were having two different conversations, although I wasn‚Äôt paying attention myself. It‚Äôs funny in hindsight, but I was confused as hell when my best friend was trying to explain it to both of us when she closed the door.

As for me, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm the loudest of my friend group, mainly because I‚Äôm also the most physically hyperactive. I also enjoy pranking the others the most, like when me and my 7w6 friend pretended to be my 3w2 friend‚Äôs girlfriend over text when he got a new phone. It was great.

As for Halloween, aside from being an enabler to the rest of the guys, I mainly remember attaching a Reese‚Äôs Cup to a Beyblade spinner and having it explode, although that‚Äôs probably the tamest thing I did all night."

1838,TalvMonster,minimalism,INFJ,"Specifically don't have an object focal point.

But, really, it's more that I want to express how my relationship to objects has changed now that I've invested so much time into carefully considering which ones i want to keep.  I'm definitely not a stoic, generally speaking.  =p"
1841,TalvMonster,minimalism,INFJ,"People refer to this as uniforming themselves.  It can be very effective for some.  Steve Jobs did this, for instance.    It does mean you never need to think, even for a moment, about what you're going to wear.      
       
I, however, do a much less stringent version.   Instead of doing a bunch of clothes that are exactly the same, I just make sure that I can wear anything I own with anything else I own.  It's going to look okay (cut and color) with anything else in the wardrobe.    A bit more thought goes into it.  But, it does give me variety, and a large number of combinations from a small number of clothes.  It also means if I'm in a hurry, I can grab anything without thinking about it and I'll still look okay for work.        "
1842,TalvMonster,declutter,INFJ,"Feeling that sense of regret as soon as you own something is probably something you can stop by more carefully considering whether or not you actually need it.  To avoid this, never buy anything just because it's on sale.  Try to put some time in between when you first decide you want a thing and when you actually buy it. Sure you want the thing this instant, but will you still feel so strongly in a week?  What if you had to wait two weeks before buying it? Would you still get it?  
   
As for everything you already own being garbage, I'm really not sure!  I don't think that's a good thing though.  I would analyze why you feel that way.  It is possible that you've latched onto the high that decluttering can give you when you let go of things. Owning only the things you love is more the point of minimalism than throwing away all of your things.  
   
I do want to offer another important possibly, however.  Many people find that as they embrace minimalism, they realize that they are holding into identities that are not really them.  They have clothes that make them blend in to other people's expectations- Objects they only have because other people think they should.   As you strip these things away, it is common for someone's, ""real self,"" to emerge.  
   
When this is the case, many people wind up hating their belongings because they tie them to their false identities.  It is common to wind up replacing those with things that you actually like.  I got rid of a lot of my old clothes when I first started and wound up buying different clothes that I actually liked.  There's no shame in this.  My closet now has only clothes that I actually enjoy wearing as a result.  
   
Minimalism is not synonymous with utilitarianism.  You're still going to own some things. Just make sure it's things worth owning.   =D"
1843,TalvMonster,simpleliving,INFJ,"Can I offer you an alternate point of view?  
Some items can definitely act as a catalyst for some people, myself included.  No one could look at my life 6 months ago and compare it to now and NOT know I've downsized massively.  That said, I definitely made some purchases along the way that helped. There's nothing wrong with 1 step back and 4 steps forward.  
   
Minimalism is NOT about how many things you own! It's about all the things you own being important and valuable to you.
   
1.  Most importantly, I bought a scanner.  As I'm an artist, I invested in a high quality art scanner.  I used it to scan all of my sentimental photographs so that I could get rid of boxes worth of them.  Space saved? Probably broke even.  However, the scanner also adds immense value to my life because now I can scan my art and stop keeping old sketches.  This is probably the easiest example I have.  
2.  I ditched all the clothes in my wardrobe that I disliked wearing.  Anything I didn't like the print or color of, anything that didn't fit perfectly, and anything that I didn't like the way the material felt on my skin.  This left my wardrobe profoundly sparse.  I'm not a fan of doing laundry several times a week.  I prefer once a week at most.  So I spent some time and money investing in a FEW, well chosen, deliberate purchases for my wardrobe.  I have no regrets.  My wardrobe is still, ""Minimized.""  I do however, have clothes I actually love wearing.  I think this is a perfectly acceptable thing to do to get yourself started.  
There are also, certainly, some more questionable purchases I've made in the name of, ""Minimalism.""  Feel free to judge them as you will.  
1.  I replaced my shitty desk that made me unhappy to look at, and which was massive with a tiny, tiny wooden desk that looks nice but secretly folds up and fits in my car easily.  I will no-longer spend another second breaking down my complicated bulky shit desk or worrying about the fact that the keyboard tray is held together with duct tape.  I find this valuable.  It is also Aesthetically minimalist, as it's so small it can no-longer function as a surface for bills / other paper to collect.  
2.  My mattress had needed replacing for a very long time.  I had a twin bed.  I am 6'3''.  I'm also diagnosed with about three sleep disorders.  Lastly, I was sentimentally attached to a bed I had owned since I was three.  I massively resented the sentimental attachment to something as large and bulky as a bed, since a lot of my goal is to remain fairly mobile.  I got rid of the mattress.  I gave the bed to my brother for my three year old niece to use as her first real bed.  I got a collapsible hammock frame, and a hammock. So, all and all, my sleep has improved going from a shit mattress to a no pressure point hammock, my room looks about 10x better, I was able to get rid of the sentimental attachment by passing it on within the family, and my brother was ecstatic having something with that much family history to pass on.  
   
I see your point about the mindset that could potentially influence asking this question, but I also feel like there are cases where, ironically, buying things for minimalism is legit."
1844,TalvMonster,minimalism,INFJ,"Minimalism can also be used to fight depression- not by itself, but it's one of many tools.   You can remove things that remind you of trama and create an environment that is peaceful instead.  It also means you have less things to worry about when you're in the worst of it.      
      
That said, if you're making major life changes to prepare to commit suicide, please consider seeking help instead.  Being depressed is like being drunk.  You can't trust your own judgement because you can't quite remember what it's like not to be in such a dark place. If you can recognize that, there's a lot you can do to start climbing back out."
1845,TalvMonster,minimalism,INFJ,"I'm not really interested in only essentials, personally.  Something can not be 100% essential and still add a lot of enjoyment to my life.   It's unfortunate that minimalism is kind of a misnomer for communicating the idea of intention ownership of things and intentional use of time.    "
1846,TalvMonster,konmari,INFJ,"I had a super similar experience recently when someone backed into the side of my car without leaving a note. It's really fascinating how ones relationships to objects changes when they begin to seriously analyze why each thing is in their life.  
""Love people, use things."" Y'know?"
1847,TalvMonster,declutter,INFJ,"This is going to sound mildly ironic. But, I'll tell you how I got over the, ""What if I need/want this later?"" moments.
You're going to throw out thousands of items before you're done with this.  Thousands and thousands of items ranging from small to big.  You will absolutely throw out at least 3-5 things you will wish you had later.  The problem is, you have absolutely no way of knowing which these will be.  
That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it anyways.  Almost everything you throw out can be replaced if you absolutely need to.  If it can't, you will honestly find that life goes on just fine anyways.  
   
Missing out on a few items you might want later is just the price you have to pay for permanently and completely changing your life for the better.  
    
Go with your gut instinct and make some impulsive choices.  You can do it! :)"
1848,TalvMonster,declutter,INFJ,"Okay, follow-up question.   Are you burning the board games?  Putting them in the trash?  Setting them in cement and then hurling them into the ocean from a speed boat late at night?    
      
No?     
      
Just because something isnt for you anymore doesn't mean someone else won't get some joy from it.  Donate them.    
      
Then, who do you have to feel guilty to?  You've done a kind thing and ideally brought some joy into the lives of people who couldn't have aquired the games new.     It's not as though they cease to exist.    
     
Are you feeling guilty to yourself?    
     
The only thing you have to feel guilty about is anchoring yourself down with things you've already decided don't add value to your life.    Let go.  :)"

I see some evidence for Fi which would support ISFP. You said you take things personally and have gut feelings about things. You try to hide your reactions to your emotions which could technically support Fi or Ti.

Some support for Ti is that you are able to easily find faults in things and find ways for people to improve and you have a hard time not getting into an argument.

So yeah as I said ISxP. Here's some guidelines to help you determine if you have Ti or Fi:

Some characteristics of Fi: You have a natural moral compass. You have a set of values that you live your life trying to adhere to. These values aren't necessarily logical but you don't care. Since you aren't easily swayed (sometimes you may act nicer to avoid conflict but that's okay), people find you authentic. You are also very aware of your emotions, even if it takes you a while to process them.

Some characteristics of Ti: You have a logical system that you are frequently ""fact-checking"" against. Your system isn't as resistant to change as a Fi user's moral compass. It's based on logic so if you find logic that proves you wrong, you are willing to update it. Since we are talking about ISTPs specifically (instead of INTPs), you may like using your logic to understand how physical things work and maybe even build them or take them apart. Think of someone who takes apart their lawnmower or builds their own computers. You are also somewhat unaware of your emotions and in fact don't really like emotions and don't really get why people get emotional. Emotions are dumb and get in the way and it's not as worth it to spend time on them.

If Fi resonates with you, you're an ISFP. If Ti, then you're are ISTP."
1851,amazonappleatari,MbtiTypeMe,INTP," I see how that is symbolic. What does that have to do with Ni? Since you were able to draw a conclusion using your intuition?

Technically you should be somewhat strong in your 5th and 6th functions, which in your case is Fe and Ni. In a way, they're inversions of your normal Fi and Ne. It's just that you prefer not to use them as much.

Since I'm an INTP, I have Ne and Ni in the same positions as you. I feel like I can draw conclusions sometimes but I'm often way more indecisive using Ne. And that projection 5 to 10 years in the future and sticking with it that Ni dominants are said to do it hard for me."
1852,amazonappleatari,MbtiTypeMe,INTP,Hmm I actually thought Se was stronger than Ne. You display a lot of hobbies that use Ti with the physical world so Se. ISTPs can understand how things work but it's usually grounded in reality in some way. Didn't see much abstract Ne topics.
1853,amazonappleatari,MbtiTypeMe,INTP,"This one is a bit tough. I'm going to guess INTP.

You said to want to be balanced by not being too logical or too emotional but otherwise you display a clear preference for thinking and logic and a clear preference for not focusing on emotions. You also said you overthink a lot and have a lot of ideas which sounds like Ti + Ne.

You did mention that reflecting on the past is important but the present is what really matters. This sounds like a possible contrast of what you think is right vs what you do. As an INTP myself, I look for the ideal way to do certain things but if you look at my actual actions I don't end up following a bunch of them out of laziness, being satisfied with understanding, etc. INTPs tend to dwell on the past a lot (Si) and have a harder time focusing on the present. I get the feeling you're in a similar both.

Another INTP trait was your Fe explosion, where you notice that every now and then you get really emotional and explode. INTPs try to stay relatively calm but every now and then (could be once a year) they will just let it all out in a fury of anger and vengeance.

I saw some possible suggestions that you might be good with Se or Fi but I don't think you lead with either of these. You said you're bad at sports and clumsy and that people think your facial expression is cold or blank. That resting face of INTPs is pretty common and people with Se tend to appear more expressive and normal. You mentioned some values which might be Fi but it felt more like a detached rehash of your values than a strong attachment you your values."
1854,amazonappleatari,MbtiTypeMe,INTP,"Yeah sorry about that. You said you consider yourself an ambivert so I wasn't sure if you were an extrovert or introvert.

Many INFPs come off as extraverts so that didn't help either lol."
1855,amazonappleatari,Adulting,INTP,"Agree that you should use cost of living calculators. It will tell you your net pay and give you an average to work on. That being said, you should try to estimate how much you yourself will likely spend. Major costs are usually rent, transportation, and student debt. Then you have groceries/eating out costs, bills like internet/utilities/phone, and miscellaneous costs like hanging out or shopping. Also moving can be expensive so if you like furniture and other stuff you can estimate that you'll spend more starting out."
1856,amazonappleatari,MbtiTypeMe,INTP,"Didn't read your post but I wrote this a while back (Didn't change the ISFP/ISTP references):

1858,amazonappleatari,MbtiTypeMe,INTP,"Yeah good luck! There really is a chance that I'm wrong lol.

I will say that I also have a similar perception regarding feelings. I model the way people act and can predict how they'll act quite frequently. I partially attribute it to the INTP pattern matching ability and that while our Fe is weak it still exists. And yeah there have been so many times when I think ""Man that will probably piss someone off or someone will probably call me out on that"" and then it happens...

I'd recommend talking to people you know are Fe dominants and see how they use Fe. (Or Fi if you think you might be an xxFP. It's harder to tell with xxFP though since it's more internal.)"

So to solve this, I'd find the size of the bath towel ([https://www.overstock.com/guides/bath-sheets-vs-bath-towels](https://www.overstock.com/guides/bath-sheets-vs-bath-towels))

Assuming the side of  the towel we see is the 60 inch side, that is folded in half to give 30 inches. 

Now we measure the time it took for the camera to cover this 30 inches - 3.77 seconds

So I can assume the camera moves at 30 inches every 3.77 seconds

Next I found out how many of these 3.77 seconds were in this video - 15.81/3.77 = 4.1936.....

Then I multiplied that number by 30 to get a total of 125.8 inches or 10ft 5.8inches

If we did this with the 35 inch side, we'd get a total of 6ft 1.39inch which seemed too small.

2109,MBMagnet,JordanPeterson,ENTJ,"It could  be dangerous if it's ill defined, applied frivolously or without proper evidence. And in this climate of man hating, that's what I fear will happen. 

Beyond cruel words, my definition of emotional abuse would include depriving a partner of their needs, career sabotage, ruining a partner's credit rating, running up debts, driving the partner's friends and family away, or putting them in unsafe situations. There are destructive things an abuser can do to cause enormous amounts of stress that don't actually involve violence. 

For instance, I knew of a female whose husband would wake her up in the middle of the night on week nights and scream at her for hours, ""picking a fight"", so she would be too tired to function at work. He would also hide her keys (the keys weren't lost, he admitted to hiding them) so she couldn't drive to work in the morning. Periodically her blood pressure medication would go missing. There were other things he did to troll her, too many to mention here. He would mess with their dog to upset her too. She was middle aged. The husband was retired and a heavy drinker, often drunk and he probably had borderline personality disorder. It was a second marriage for both. He never once hit or touched her in an aggressive way so it didn't legally qualify as ""domestic violence"". She was so relieved when the divorce papers were finalized. 

If a crazed partner wants to make your life hell, they can. "
2110,MBMagnet,JordanPeterson,ENTJ,"Even if you have a legal right to get your belongings back and/or take them to your Dad's, what action would take against your Mom and Step Dad? Sue them? Report a theft to the police? Would that be the highest possible good you can conceive of? 

It may not be true that your stepfather hates you. His words were harsh and I'm sure it stung to hear he didn't want you there. But maybe he would be okay with you being there if you made efforts to earn his trust? Is it possible to improve the relationship you have with him? 

Even as adults we need our families. Unless you've been on the receiving end of true abuse, it isn't justifiable to burn bridges with parents. Even when you turn 18, you may not have the mean$ and life skills to move out and successfully live on your own. Likely you'll continue to need help from the adults in your life in your late teens. We live in complex societies and I don't know many 18 year olds who can manage well on their own. 

So yeah, make nice with your parents and try to maintain good relations with them as best you can. If you do that, the next 9 months will probably be less difficult than you fear. Take courage!

You don't really need her anymore,  it's almost done.   Call her manager immediately this is an outlandish breach of her duties as an agent.   She owes you duties that should have been explained in the consumer notice you signed and has a duty to place your interests above her own even if she's representing both you and the buyers.   Do you have an agency contract with her?   There is no reason having a different agent take over your end should affect settlement.   Is she representing the buyers too?  You can PM me.   You possibly even have a case against her with the real estate commission

2189,Atlas_B_Shruggin,PurplePillDebate,INTJ,"they don't know they're not being honest

if you ask a woman what shes looking for in a man PHYSICALLY ATTRACTIVE IS ASSUMED.  they dont think you mean ""what do you find physically attractive""  they respond as if you asked ""ok, among all the men who are physically attractive enough, who are the only men you even consider in the first place, THEN what do you like in a man""

when you hear a woman say ""i want a man whos kind, smart and funny"" they mean ON TOP of being physically attractive enough, they never mean ""kind smart and funny AND you dont have to be physically attractive AT all"""
2190,Atlas_B_Shruggin,PurplePillDebate,INTJ,"it doesnt have to mbe morally justified, nor is it based in her contribution or any conception of ""deserving""

a marriage is like a legal partnership in the eyes of the law.  when you are married you each own 100% of the marital assets.   when you divorce you are each apportioned 50/50 in a community property state or some other portion in an equitable distribution state.  there is no moral issue here.  this is about legal joint ownership of all marital assets by the MARRIAGE.  the marriage is a legla union, a ""corporate person"" economically.  

marriage is not employment.  she was not the marriage's employee, she didnt own the marital assets because of her ""contribution"" to the marriage but because of the legal state of marriage and nothing else.  again, DURING the marriage she had 100% ownership of all the marital assets, and so did he.  by divorcing SHE LOSES HALF OF HER ASSETS TOO, she doesnt GAIN half of HIS assets

we can argue over whether it should be this way, and since only nine states are pure 50/50 community property states obviosuly other arrangements are possible

the moralizing of the arrangement is baseless and nuts.

when i was at the height of my attractivenes to men i spent hours crying in the mirror over my intrasexual beauty marker flaws.  my hips too square, my head too flat, my nose too big, clothes didnt fit me like they fit other girls on and on and on.  all the male attention in the world didnt alleviate my comparing myself to OTHER WOMEN and coming up short TO MYSELF

-  When you invade and die on a host's world, your bloodstain should be where you initiated the invasion, not where you died on the host's world. 

- Soldering Iron could get a buff, maybe a 50% damage buff and the estus cancelling effect should be  50% longer. I understand it isn't a ""serious"" weapon, but it can still have a use/niche. 

- Make titanite slabs farmable, or have the handmaiden sell an unlimited amount... Let's say 100k souls for a slab and 50k souls for a gem. 

- Increase rewards for invasions. If an invader defeats the host he/sheshould get 10% of the souls needed to level up, if the host kills the invader, then the host gets 50% of the souls. Same goes for RSS duels. I'm tired of getting just barely enough souls to buy a green blossom, let alone all the other stuff I've used after a duel. Autosummon invasions should get the soul values stated above and a randomly generated upgrade material. 

- A blue eye orb, please! 

- Maybe increase the values needed to rank up in the arena, please? I got two gold badges a day after the other, in perhaps less than 5 hours of playtime, that's pretty bad... 

Maybe it should be something like this: 

15 wins for stone; 
50 wins for bronze; 
150 wins for silver; 
500 wins for gold. 

- Add all boss rooms as arena maps!   

Can't think of more stuff, right now D;

*edit* 

- Armour defence values should not have a boost/penalty if the whole body isn't covered up! I like going bare chested and I'm not a big fan of using helmets either...  

- No upper level limit for invasions of any kind. But have it progressively increase in level, if hosts are not found at the same level as the player.

2296,ApocalypticCandy,ADHD,ESTJ,"The coffee part is BS. You're absolutely right that caffeine and amphetamine are different types of stimulants. Actual ADHD meds work better for most people, otherwise there's no point in going to the doctor every few months for prescriptions. A giant can of coffee costs $10.

She might be telling the truth about her meds not keeping her awake, but it's not typical."
2297,ApocalypticCandy,ADHD,ESTJ,"They don't get that the distractions, and expectations, are different. Pressure to perform well, and knowing I'd be graded on every minute detail and get points marked off for mistakes, made it a lot scarier to study and do assignments than play a game with zero consequences beyond losing and having to start the game over."
2298,ApocalypticCandy,ADHD,ESTJ,"That's not normal in the USA, not for standard ADHD medication. Psychiatrists ask about what else you're on, because some meds interact with others. If they're demanding that you take a different medication outside their specialty, that's a red flag. Mine wanted to know what I was taking, but not taking anything else wasn't a problem.

And she should have asked about other symptoms in session. If you can pick a different doctor, consider doing that."
2299,ApocalypticCandy,MbtiTypeMe,ESTJ,"ESTP does look more likely than ENTJ. Se-Ti vs Te-Ni. Se-Ti shares preference for external action with Te, and ENTJ has Se lower in the stack, so there are some similar behaviors produced by different motivations. I don't see high Ni here.

There's not a lot here to determine tertiary Fe vs. inferior Fi. Slightly more evidence of low-stack Fe than low-stack Fi, which fits. The first two functions are more important, especially at 19 when lower functions are weaker."
2300,ApocalypticCandy,ADHD,ESTJ,">Also the lack of specificity.. ""do better"" How? Which part of better am I getting wrong? When should I apply this? So many questions un-answered!

This. This is the worst part, people complaining about someone not doing good enough, but not giving any actionable advice, not even one or two specific suggestions to help with one part of the problem."
2301,ApocalypticCandy,ADHD,ESTJ,"I didn't like CBT for a lot of these reasons. There's an assumption, by many programs/practitioners, that any negative thoughts are wrong - when sometimes they're actually spot-on. Ideally, the first thing they do is see whether or not the negative thought is true, and then handle true and false ones differently. False thoughts need challenged, but true thoughts are pointing at a real problem that needs fixed differently. Sometimes you get a good therapist who does that. Sometimes you get one that handwaves any real complaints away as ""oops! negative thinking! that's a no-no!"", or plays a crappy semantics game when you use ""always"" colloquially to mean ""usually"" and they argue with you on the grounds that it's not literally always true. Just because I showed up early to one appointment doesn't mean I didn't have serious time management issues...

I had successful therapy, but about half of it was self-help, and none of it this round was CBT. It works for some people and some issues, done correctly. Too often it's done incorrectly or not the right solution in the first place."
2302,ApocalypticCandy,MbtiTypeMe,ESTJ,"Then yes, ENTP is more likely."
2303,ApocalypticCandy,ADHD,ESTJ,"Weightlifting. I don't like running - results are slow and it's boring. It also doesn't really help me in day-to-day life because I already have no problem walking long distances or staying generally active without getting tired. Strength training makes me better able to carry heavy things and move even heavier things around. It's a more satisfying accomplishment since I'm small.

I sometimes walk instead of drive if it's a short distance and I don't have to bring a lot of stuff back with me. It feels less pointless than running even though otherwise it's not very different: it saves a little gas and completes an errand.

Got injured and can't work for a week, can't exercise much either so this is annoying. At least I'm clear to move around - some walking and light upper body exercise is okay. Better than nothing."
2304,ApocalypticCandy,ADHD,ESTJ,I usually like it. It's much easier for me to maintain a long conversation with a call than texts; one 15-minute chat vs. dozens of interruptions over a few hours.
2305,ApocalypticCandy,ADHD,ESTJ,"One thing at a time. Either pick a part of the apartment, or an overall task (like picking up and taking out the trash), do that, and maintain that until it doesn't take as much effort. Then add more, and more, until you're doing all of it. Ex. don't even concern yourself with whether or not the cupboards are neat, just make sure there's nothing expired or spilled in it and move on at first.

I still have trouble with ""invisible"" tasks like dusting and cleaning floorboards - ugh. If I'm ever rich I'm going to hire someone for those. Keeping everything straightened up and basically clean isn't hard anymore, though if I'm without meds too long I slip some on the neatness part."

If I don't care about looking odd or they can't see it, I ""type"" the name out with finger taps as if I'm typing it on a keyboard. That helps some with remembering names. FWIW I have very bad auditory memory and pretty good kinesthetic memory so I don't know if this is an ADHD thing or a me thing."

2318,ghostakir2,Enneagram9,INFP,"So if I'm reading this right, it sounds like you want him to be more motivated or to move forward? I wouldn't know the solution to your problem or his, as every situation and person is different, but hopefully I can help by sharing my own story. (Im a 9 and im pretty sure Im an sp) I personally had trouble during high school with homework, as I could never motivate myself to do it. My mom (a 1) was really bothered by this and struggled with what she could say/do to make me get things done, knowing I was stubborn and didn't like to be nagged. Heres a few points on what you could maybe do?

1. It is truly amazing what blossoms in someone when they are loved and accepted for who they are. She and other good people in my life, started loving me with my love language ( Mine being words of affirmation/quality time. Look it up if you've never heard of it, it's a life changer.) I, and my family and friends, are by no means perfect, and we do not always love each other the best. But we try, and my life is all the better.
2. I had to make some tough decisions for my life, and I made those all by myself. I don't think anyone could have told me or made me do it. But because of the people around me loving me and supporting me, I started to thrive. I also had to get to know myself in order to understand how I like to do things.
3. I was told truth, like how awesome I am, and how I deserve a good life. Eventually I started to believe it. It is crazy how we go through life, making often unconscious decisions about ourselves and the world (such as I don't deserve happiness or Im a failure).

I hope this wasn't too long, and it maybe gives you some ideas on what you can do as a supporter. Remember, you aren't responsible for someone else's choices. It's hard, but give yourself a break. Do your best to be there for them. It sounds cliche, but really the choice is up to them. Good luck!!"

2381,Block12425,pvzneighborville,ISTJ,"I have been playing a bit more, and I coming to realize that a lot of the characters don't feel that satisfying. Sure, the stuttering and weird mouse sensitivity makes it feel worse, but I genuinely think that the characters just don't feel as good compared to the last game.

Besides that, so far, I am enjoying Captain Deadbeard and Engineer in the zombies side. I normally am not a fan of sniper characters, but I played him a lot in the last game, and he still manages to feel satisfying. Unfortunately, his shotgun got nerfed hard, so that doesn't feel great. His anchor feels great and his barrel is a good emergency tool. Plus, the head hurtbox in this game seems generous compared to other games.

As for engineer, I played him a bit in the last game, but now, they reworked him with elements that I am quite familiar with. His turret allows me to pull some Torbjorn strats, and his concrete launcher functions like Junkrat's grenade launcher. Both of those I enjoyed quite a bit. His speed pad allows me to be a taxi character, and his sonic grenade is a good answer to the annoying night caps and sneaking chompers. And today, I just discovered that my turret reloads my gun. Now I can spam my weapon at choke points and get some kills, and prevent anyone else from approaching.

For the plant side, I am not sure. I like Citron. I wasn't that big of fan of him last game, if I remember correctly, but how they reworked him makes him more enjoyable for me. His shield is nice (I would not want that on a cd, since I think it is more useful if I can pull it out when I need it. I also like his laser for some quick pokes, but I disliked how the laser felt in the last game. I prefer the primary weapon he has right now.), and allows me to help the team quite a bit.

The other plant characters do not pop up that much. I probably should try Cactus a bit more, but the flying ability feels weird. Also, the mines are less emergency useful than the barrel. I do like Acorn, but getting randoms to work together is tricky.

As for the heroes I think I would enjoy but do not now because of changes: Kernel Corn (too weak), All-Star (Find it more difficult to support the team, and his weapon feels weak), Rose (I do like the speed boost, but the tracking is very weak, meaning that many shots miss. On top of that the damage is weak. The Goat ability is better, but I find it has some bugs. Overall too passive for my liking.).

And finally, disclaimer, I have not played the new characters too much, and I still need to play some of the other characters to see if I like them or not."

Filled with pure joy you head back inside to open it up. You feel the box is a tad too light, but you don't pay too much attention to it. You finally open it up and peek inside.

If you don't reach that, then it will always come to excuses. It only takes 1 minute of weakness to start edging and around 5 to 30 on average to cum...do you think that a successful Fapstronaut manages to keep himself uncomfortable and not bored 24/7? I personally don't think so, even men with ""perfect"" lives (lets say an amazing girlfriend, money, friends, success, etc) go through hard times and find at least 1 minute of weakness and fap. 

I read a lot of comments of people saying ""get out of your house, find some new activities, take a cold shower, etc...and I stand by what they say, it is helpful and healthy advice, its just that its not there when we thrive but in the hardest moments.

2538,topnotchwalnut,Petioles,ISFJ,"In my experience, the munchies are a combination of weed causing the physical sensation of hunger AS WELL AS a mental pattern I have developed.

It‚Äôs almost unconscious, but usually when I smoke, there is the thought in my mind that ‚Äúnow it is time to eat.‚Äù It‚Äôs like I believe that in order to have the full ‚Äúhigh‚Äù experience, I also need to engage the munchies and enjoy how much better food tastes. Like being high and eating are required to go together.

Becoming aware of this pattern has helped me a lot. I had to stop getting stoned before going out to eat because it was reinforcing the idea that weed enhances the experience of food.

For me, started from season 5 winx kinda lots its common sense. I understand that creators wanted to appeal to a younger audience, however it would have been much better if they did not continue the storyline after season 4 and instead created a new series or a spin off for younger kids. (I am not talking about Netflix spin off)"

Compared to their original outfits, those looked distasteful not even childish, just distasteful. Most people like Tecna's new enchantix but I honestly think that only Musa's new enchantix is more or less bearable. I do think that pinkinsh wings suit her better than yellow ones. It is also hard to look at Aishas new enchantix, I think it changed so much. Too much pink on everyone. Also, the transformation process copied from Sirenix and Tynix."

They had cool villans, interesting storylines, cool transformations and power upgrades that unfortunately started to degrade in following seasons.

Surprise surprise, a really creepy guy kept trying to grind up on one of the girls. She felt really uncomfortable and moved to the other side of the little huddle we were in. The guy seemed to take the hint and left...or so we thought. 15 minutes later, and my friend feels someone grinding up against her again. Same old creepy dude. 

What happened next was too crazy to process in real time. My high school buddy pulled the guy off the girl, and straight up just started kissing him. A sloppy wet kiss on the lips, tongue and everything. In what was the most surreal 3-5 seconds of my life, just as the old dude started to process what was happening, my buddy shouted ‚ÄúRUN!‚Äù In one quick motion, he pushed the guy backwards into a couple other people, grabbed the girls, and we bolted out of the club onto the street.

For those of you who haven‚Äôt been to 6th Street, there‚Äôs a section of the street that‚Äôs blocked off, and on each side of the street is a row of bars. There‚Äôs a huge crowd of people just walking in the middle of the street, hopping from bar to bar. As soon as we got out, we quickly blended into the crowd and headed straight for another bar.

"
2640,blonde_charlotte,LinkinPark,INFP,"I have to disagree, but personally I don't feel offended. this is your own opinion so it's okay, you have right to feel that way. to me, I don't think that Post-Traumatic is lacking anything, I don't compare it to LP discography. it is different album - of course it is. it's not Linkin Park's, it's Mike Shinoda's. it's his point of view, and his way to express himself - that's how I see it. the fact that Post-Traumatic is a little bit raw, a little less sleek album just fits the idea that it's in fact the record of Mike's fight with trauma, grieve and other feelings. like, you know - diaries usually aren't super-sleek, cause it's not the point of them. the point lies in sincere, raw feelings.

2688,AzukiSama,intermittentfasting,ENTP,"i suggest instead of 7 day fast, do 2-3 day fast and some IF/Omad, and then another 2-3 day fast next week to break platforms. After 72h your body will be more likely to lose muscle density than fat, ketosis would help but even if u are in ketosis you'd still lose lean body mass. The best way is a short 48h fast to clear ur digestive system and/or hiit/weight/resistance training.

I am 5'7 and I had winter fats exactly like ur first pic (SW153, CW149, gaining muscle as well as cutting so still far from 135GW)

2691,AzukiSama,intermittentfasting,ENTP,"whether your body burns more fat or ur muscle in extended fasting period over 72h is still undetermined. No doctor or nutritionist should or can tell you that definitely, because each fasting on every individual is different, your biological gene is different, your eating habits is different, your medical history is different. for example OP and I are Asian females in 20s, our ethnicity and gene and fat cell distribution on our body is primarily different than a caucasian female.

So if you go back to my original reply, I said ' **likely** to decrease muscle density over fat'because growing up common asian cooking and diet are mostly carbs and then protein and then fibre which is carbs, least of all is fat. (stir fry dishes with rice, stew with rice etc.we don't eat fatty meat or put too much butter in dishes or sauce) 

So my point is, like me OP was new to low carb diet and our body are not used to consume fat, **especially look at her previous photo, her body figure suggested she was not obese and was within normal weight to begin with*

Thats why i concluded she is like me, *likely* to have decrease muscle density over fat in extended fasting period.

But what triggers me the most is when someone doesn't think I'm intelligent enough or jokes about my intelligence or performance (for example, in studies).

So I downloaded Duolingo and completed the first round in a year and a half. While doing this I used to listen only English music and write down the lyrics and then the Spanish translation, and try to sing along to master the accent. When I finished the first round on Duolingo I also started watching TV series and movies in English with subtitles. Then reading in English. I think when I was 16 I already sounded native-like but needed to expand my vocabulary and to work on grammar. Now I consider myself as fluent and I sound pretty much native most of the time. I didn't practice with anyone while learning since I've always been very perfectionist and I didn't want people to listen any mispronounciation or grammar mistake or anything, but since I'm 16-17 I've had to do it to improve my English. Well, that's my story haha, I guess I just love languages and I find learning languages through media fits perfectly with in introvertion."

There's not much you can do when you love someone with an avoidant personality, which sounds like what he has. I mean... threatening to call the cops? Seriously??

No you are not.  It is not selfish to want a partner who fulfils you in ways that are important to you.  Sex and intimacy are important.  I have had a few long term relationships (44 F) and will never do a non BDSM relationship ever again.  Feels like something is missing.  Sex becomes a 'chore' when you aren't into it.

IME of living in farm country and working on the odd dairy farm (I raised and trained horses myself) the vast majority of farmers are very good to their animals.  Most love animals.

Then he slapped it.  Hard.  I was like ""I think I like this one!"""

His Razer Green switches reached the end of their lives after three years of faithful service. The keyboard will now be reassigned to office duties with more appropriate Cherry MX Clear switches. I personally love Cherry MX Clear switches, maybe a bit too much... Definitely a bit too much.

This was the first time I've done any soldering on a mechanical keyboard, certainly the first time I have desoldered anything. I've read a lot of posts from people who are afraid to touch their PCBs with soldering irons, I'd definitely recommend it. This PCB in particular was impossible to break, but the pins for Cherry switches are also pretty big, a good place to get started imo.

Also, note the BlackWidow has no RWIN key and it actually seems to send the wrong keycode for RSHIFT."

2795,cipheos,thebutton,INTJ,"The button does not so much round up as completely ignore the tenths since they are kept track of client-side. The server (reddit) sends a tick every second which is pretty much just a message that contains the current time of the button and some other data. The client (your pc) will adjust it's timer accordingly with every tick. This is why ##:00 rarely happens because it often syncs before that. When you press, your client returns some of the data to the server to verify that you haven't cheated. We owe the fact that a 0s flair exist to the existance of the 0s tick, when you return that data you get a 0s flair. I'm not sure how much time one has to return the data but apparently it has happened, *presumably* before the button ended."

2812,Kripke123,AskReddit,ISFJ,"I epillate my legs regularly and don't have too much trouble with it, but I understand what you mean. The first time freaked me out, I only did a few hairs on my ankle and then didn't try again for a while. But one time I decided to do my armpits and just pull through, and I did even though I bled a lot. But once the hair grows out, as you said, it's much thinner and it barely hurts at all! 

Sorry to say this, but the first time is probably going to be the most painful. Although if you then do it regularly and don't let the hair grow out too much, I wouldn't even the describe it as painful. For your first time though, maybe just trim the hair so it's not too long. There are also epillators with different settings and caps to make it less painful. I have one for example with a ""beginner's cap"" and a ""gentle cap"" and they pluck fewer hairs at a time. 

Other than that, I don't think there's much else I can say than to just pull through. If you keep going at it, you'll eventually feel sort of numb and it's not that bad. Also, I think after 7 years you'll maybe find the experience to be different. A lot of the pain also comes from the expectation and fear of the pain. I find it helps a lot trying to mentally calm down and not work myself up too much. Hope that helps!"

2824,pale-pink,frugalmalefashion,ISFP,"I'm 6'3 195lbs and I wear a medium for most pants/shorts, especially athletic wear because I don't want my pants to fall down at the gym.

also athletic pants usually have a fixed inseam across all sizes, so sizing up doesn't make them longer. or it's only an inch or two difference and I'd rather have pants that stay on at the gym than have pants that are long enough but also fall down."
2825,pale-pink,AskReddit,ISFP,"I worked security at a pretty big building with huge parking lots. Used to be an airplane manufacturing plant I think and was converted into more of a storage facility for cars. I did patrol 2 shifts and then one shift inside watching cameras. During the patrol shifts, whoever was working had to get out of the car and scan these barcodes that were set up around the perimeter of the facility(but still inside our fence), just to ensure that the security guards were actually patrolling instead of just driving partially through the place. 

 So I'm doing a patrol, probably was around 1 - 3 AM, and I'm going around to one corner of the facility where you can see the other side of the street. It's dead empty outside except for this pickup truck parked on the other side of the street in a parking lot(front of the truck was facing towards my patrol car), and this guy was dancing around next to his truck. I think he was holding a bottle or some plastic bag or something. This dude was just dancing around and singing. I'm sure he noticed me, I was playing loud music from the car and it also had orange flashing patrol lights on, but I tried not to look at him when I got out and scanned that corner's barcode.  Anyway I had to do a patrol every hour, so I kept going by that same spot. And he was there for the entire night until I left(or maybe he was gone on my last patrol, I don't remember). Nothing crazy, but I thought it was weird. He was definitely on something"

No cheating is allowed (e.g. fresh cream). Also, traditionally you only use Pecorino Romano but some like to do it with Parmiggiano Reggiano too (like 50/50 pecorino and parmiggiano).

Guanciale is also very good for ""crostini"": you toast some bread, slice some guanciale very thin and put it on the bread. Add a touch of honey and walnuts (oh, you can substitute guanciale with thin slices of lard). Try it and let me know if you like it ;)"

2888,charmedjustice,datingoverthirty,INFJ,"I think your sentiment is so relatable. There's always the potential for incredible vulnerability in saying that you want to be in a relationship, but especially when you carry insecurities about your desirability or your readiness. As mothers, we often come to identify ourselves as nurturers and caretakers. Confessing our deeply held romantic needs can seem out of character and even humiliating. In that diminished space we can become prone to stuffing our feelings and taking whatever we can get sometimes, believing perhaps that we're ""too much"" or that what we want isn't even that important or attainable. I think that overcoming this mindset requires understanding how much you genuinely deserve having what it is you desire. It's about as simple as public speaking for the socially anxious, but your hopefulness will carry you through. You got this!"
2889,charmedjustice,datingoverthirty,INFJ,"I'm sorry that he decided to treat you this way. It's cruel, unfair and risk damaging your ability to love & trust long-term. Try not to go there and see him for who he's shown himself to be. People who operate this way tend to be poor assessors and extraordinary repressors of their own feelings. They can be expert at deception and avoidance of all sorts, but they're especially mastered at self-deception. Because they lack self-awareness, they're often led around quite unconsciously by emotion that they can't begin to control, process or articulate well enough that you can both solve whatever problem they think they're having. So they leave. It means their work is done and they can feel  relief in the moment. These people are rarely if ever great partners and often are simply seeking out men and women as a drug of choice. Once the hit wears off (ie, the ""feeling"" they're chasing), they leave. It sucks. I'm sorry."
2890,charmedjustice,datingoverthirty,INFJ,"People who do this, break up a relationship that's growing stable and healthily, are almost always poor long-term partners dealing with codependency. They're often spark chasers who use people as their drug of choice and when they can no longer get high off the person, they either create an escalation of interpersonal drama (cheating, stealing, lying to you) or they bail and find a new hit. 

I had a relationship with someone like this and even our breakup was loving and kind. His previous relationship was dangerous to the point of police involvement and he'd been cheated on. I loved him very much, but love myself more. Haven't talked to him since. Healthy relationships are primarily created,  not felt."
2891,charmedjustice,datingoverthirty,INFJ,"Mine's not the success story you're looking for, but it is a success story. I garnered the strength to finalize my divorce after years of separation when the last guy I gave my heart to told me that he wasn't ready. I got involved with him knowing that he was newly separated, working through an addiction and trying to get a stable co-parenting schedule off the ground with a woman who he had a dangerously toxic relationship with. 

After our breakup I had the opportunity to sit with all of my rationalizations for allowing myself to get so heavily involved with him given the complexity of his situation and I was finally able to recognize my own ambivalence about being in another long-term commitment. I'd had other commited relationships during my separation and had no doubts about my readiness until our breakup. So I ask, are you genuinely ready for and desiring of a commited relationship? What about this woman did or did not indicate that she was ready to give you what you desired long-term? Because so often the people we attract and then further decide to be in relationship with mirror our own struggles, even if unconsciously. 

She cares about you but may still never return to show up in the way you deserve. My ex was also upset during our breakup because I told him I didnt think we could stay in touch. The breakup itself was passionate and deeply intimate and exemplified how we treated each other. It's also the last we've spoken in months beyond social media likes. It's hard to not overanalyze but try to take this like any other breakup. Just another closed door yielding the way for what you truly hope for, with or without her."

There are hard sciences, soft sciences and pseudosciences, and temperament psychology ‚Äî in any of its better-established varieties, including the MBTI and the Big Five ‚Äî belongs (along with most of psychology) in the ""soft science"" category, and the MBTI can actually point to years of studies that basically put it on a par (psychometrically speaking) with the Big Five.

Anyone who's interested can read more about that ‚Äî and about several other issues often raised by people claiming to ""debunk"" the MBTI ‚Äî in this l-o-n-g PerC post:

[Another MBTI ""Debunking""](http://personalitycafe.com/myers-briggs-forum/283457-another-mbti-debunking.html#post8744961)

Among the sources cited in that PerC post is [a 2003 meta-review and large-sample study](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.4902&rep=rep1&type=pdf) that summed up the MBTI's relative standing in the personality type field this way:

>In addition to research focused on the application of the MBTI to solve applied assessment problems, a number of studies of its psychometric properties have also been performed (e.g., Harvey & Murry, 1994; Harvey, Murry, & Markham, 1994; Harvey, Murry, & Stamoulis, 1995; Johnson & Saunders, 1990; Sipps, Alexander, & Freidt, 1985; Thompson & Borrello, 1986, 1989; Tischler, 1994; Tzeng, Outcalt, Boyer, Ware, & Landis, 1984). Somewhat surprisingly, given the intensity of criticisms offered by its detractors (e.g., Pittenger, 1993), a review and meta-analysis of a large number of reliability and validity studies (Harvey, 1996) concluded that in terms of these traditional psychometric criteria, the MBTI performed quite well, being clearly on a par with results obtained using more well-accepted personality tests.

...and the authors went on to describe the results of their own 11,000-subject study, which they specifically noted were inconsistent with the notion that the MBTI was somehow of ""lower psychometric quality"" than Big Five (*aka* FFM) tests. They said:

>In sum, although the MBTI is very widely used in organizations, with literally millions of administrations being given annually (e.g., Moore, 1987; Suplee, 1991), the criticisms of it that have been offered by its vocal detractors (e.g., Pittenger, 1993) have led some psychologists to view it as being of lower psychometric quality in comparison to more recent tests based on the FFM (e.g., McCrae & Costa, 1987). In contrast, we find the findings reported above ‚Äî especially when viewed in the context of previous confirmatory factor analytic research on the MBTI, and meta-analytic reviews of MBTI reliability and validity studies (Harvey, 1996) ‚Äî to provide a very firm empirical foundation that can be used to justify the use of the MBTI as a personality assessment device in applied organizational settings.

McCrae and Costa are the leading Big Five psychologists, and authors of the NEO-PI-R, and after reviewing the MBTI's history and status (including performing their own psychometric analysis) back in 1990 ‚Äî using an earlier version of the MBTI (Form G) than the one being used today ‚Äî [they concluded](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/20447534_Reinterpreting_the_Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator_from_the_perspective_of_the_five-factor_model_of_personality) that the MBTI and the Big Five might each have things to teach the other, approvingly pointed to the MBTI's ""extensive empirical literature,"" and suggested that their fellow Big Five typologists could benefit by reviewing MBTI studies for additional insights into the four dimensions of personality that the two typologies essentially share, as well as ""valuable replications"" of Big Five studies.

I mean i‚Äôm not always thinking, i have moments of deep thinking but that‚Äôs when i must solve a problem. Other than that, i jump into the situation to see how it evolves, and when someone says something I obsessively read that phrase in my mind to try to catch hidden meanings. But, when i must complete a task, i like to experiment in order to acquire knowledge on how to do it better. I think mostly in the pause time between a try and another"

2974,ChristianBrothers92,introvert,ENTP,"It sounds like you and OP may be protecting yourselves from some perceived danger by not showing up when it more than likely doesn't exist. 

Not showing up takes the anxiety away; however, a new form of anxiety is introduced and based on a potentially more likely and actual threat (i.e., my friend my be mad at me and my friend may stop inviting me out).

I like how you say not all introverts are depressed and/or anxious. Infact, I suspect a lot of people on MBTI related forums believing they are MBTI introverts are actually MBTI extroverts that have social anxiety.  This is especially the case if someone is typed using a standard free MBTI assessment rather than one that assesses cognitive functions.  What would be important here is the standard test would match your responses to stereotype responses from percentages of E/I, S/N, T/F, and J/P rather than probing for why you chose the answers you did; the latter gets at cognitive function preferences (i.e., NeTi in my case).

Your cognitive functions, although may be related, don't dictate how much social interaction you crave or want to avoid.  For instance my cognitive function preferences map on to ENTP. Although I have an E in my MBTI code, I am an ambivert, socially; however, I do feel energized while around others that I can get into interesting discussions with, even if they are strangers. If I had social anxiety, I would probably test as INTP on inaccurate MBTI assessments because it's incorrectly looking at social interaction preferences rather than cognitive functions when measuring E and I.

No matter what your MBTI type is, I agree that mental health should be considered at any time one is making decisions they don't like and they often think ""I can't,"" despite wanting to and being aware of risks (i.e., potentially losing a friend). It sounds like it has both been painful and stressful for you and OP; this is not something you all should have to bear alone. I think you owe it to yourselves to be able to make decisions without social anxiety constraints."

2993,purplepharaoh1,BobsBurgers,INTP,"Peter and Stan are misogynists who rely almost entirely on shock value.  Sometimes they're funny but a little of it goes a very long way with me.

Also, I don't like shows that have one character that gets the butt of the jokes. I.E. Meg.  I don't mind a character that gets the short end of the stick by chance in various situations, that can be relatable and funny if done correctly, but when you're *singled out and bullied* it's just depressing. People like that exist too, and it's never funny to me. It's part of why so many people have emotional problems.

Bob's Burger's has awkward weird characters, (the Belchers themselves, and their friends/neighbors) but they don't just cruelly laugh at one person's expense and single them out in every episode, unless you're talking about actual enemies like Bob and Jimmy Pesto but that's a different dynamic entirely."

3003,StevoBrando,Animemes,INFP,U most definitely should. Somehow became my favourite romance anime (granted I haven't watched many) and one of my favourite dramas
3004,StevoBrando,Persona5,INFP,"This game became my favourite after 1 play through. It is very dialogue heavy but you'd be suprised at how much you'll be invested in it. I won't lie to u by saying certain parts of the story are stretched out and repetitive, but the narrative of persona 5 is amazing, both thematically and emotionally. 
As for gameplay, you have nothing to worry about. I could talk for ages about it the depth of its systems and how they connect with each other but u can probably find a good video for that. I have only 2 (And a half) complaints with it.
1) My main and only real complaint is mementos, the overarching dungeon of the entire game, expanding the further you progress. It's repetitive and dull with the same music and the same setting for almost hours but it's also something you have to take care of as it's something important to the plot later on... just grind through it. Tbh it's probably not as bad as your thinking
2) Its impossible to finish the game in 1 go... take that how you will. It's insanely long (roughly 100 hours) and it has even more confidants, quests and personas to unlock that you probably couldn't or didn't have time for the first time (story progresses over 1 year so time is limited)
3) This is the half I was talking about. The difficulty is pretty intense at times. I'm not really the strategic type but the game rewards having a well versed arsenal of personas and creatively using them. Around the 3rd dungeon is when they start having enemies that are resistant to multiple things and may have no weaknesses which makes them hard to defeat. But if u are the strategic type it probably won't phase you (unless you go hard mode)
But yeah in conclusion...
Go buy it"

3022,5wing6,bangtan,INFP,"Yes, love is very complicated and there are many different kinds of ‚Äúlove.‚Äù I think a problem with people not ‚Äúmaturating‚Äù comes down to the fact that they may be putting themselves in an environment where they cant? For example, surrounding oneself with many other ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù ‚Äúobsessive‚Äù fans can hinder one from recognizing media and the industry influence if that makes sense? Lots of people build community based off of similar interests and form echo chambers of sorts "
3023,5wing6,bangtan,INFP,Its really terrifying to know that while they are the minority there are still creepy sassing and obsessed fans who have the resources to do crazy things. I guess my major concern is that for a few it could start out as harmless comments and then evolve into obsessive behavior?

That is why sasaengs who try to infringe upon that and invade their privacy really concern me :(

When we become infatuated with anyone, especially celebrities, we often have expectations for our ‚Äúideal partner‚Äù that are set a little to high and are unrealistic. But as long as they learn the difference between a constructed fantasy and reality afterwards, maybe its not such a bad thing for teens to go through an experience like yours.

On the sexualization topic, it is hard to ignore something when its omnipresent. They must be very strong to put up with everything thats projected onto them and its extremely admirable i know i would crumble under all of that "
3028,5wing6,bangtan,INFP,"I really really wanted to touch on disassociation/coping mechanisms in this post but i was afraid of offending or crossing the line with those who have personal experience with those things. I believe it is more common than not, and it may be very hard for some to separate music from the artist or fantasy from reality (which is why i have been putting an emphasis on younger folk). Even if the industry is focused on marketing fantasy i just hope that bts arent placed in uncomfortable situations too often, especially regarding sasaengs and the like "

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the learner decks, but from my experience they just kinda sit around because you're not able to use them in tournaments. To me, they really aren't worth the extra money for the starter deck.

Ideally, you should never be in a situation where you need to retreat- However, plans don't always work out, and it's a great way to pull an ally who has fallen out of the danger zone, and possibly into a clerics range of *Breath of Life* if the worst happens.  


So, me and my party where fighting some serpentfolk in the Emerald Spire when we managed to kill their boss. Unfortunately, their was a political schism and one of the Serpentfolk vying for control had managed to dominate one of our NPC's earlier in the dungeon... And none of us caught on. At first, our dominated pc was commanded to lay low, and pretend nothing was abnormal. Failed save. After defeating the ""boss"", our pc was commanded to attack us- Another failed save.  


After some panicked discussion, our witch used wall of ice to create some tactical cover, while our rouge started lockpicking a door to get us a new exit, as our entrance was occupied by summoned monsters, courtesy of the Serpentfolk behind the domination.  


However, I was able to use *Cut your Losses* to... retreat with the boss's dead corpse in tow, hiding in an adjacent room: No use letting all that loot get lost. Eventually we managed to regroup, with only 1 pc death amongst us, but ever sense then if I have a spare feat, it tends to be taken by *Cut your losses*."
3064,SuperTentaBrella,DragaliaLost,INTP,"It all started when I followed a QR code I found in the dumpster behind an abandoned gamestop under the full moon. It lead me to Dragalia Lost's App page... But something was different. off.

Dragalia Lost.Exe

On a whim I downloaded it. The Loading Screens were pitch black, and sometimes the characters heads tilted just a hair farther than normal- It was unnerving, but my first 10-pull netted me Wedding Ellie, Xander AND Long Long, so I didn't want to delete it. But... Still, playing my dailies on the reset always made me nervous. Jumpy- Tree branches would scrape against my window... Footsteps outside my door would be my imagination- The Fafnir's... bled? So red- For some reason when I try and screenshot it, my phone crashes. Nobody believes me. I tried taking a photo of my screen- The game suddenly loaded Wedding Aoi, but with cursed red eyes, telling me she would find me. I... Don't understand- I didn't pull her- I guess it's part of her story?

I left feedback. ""My game is bugged, and loading scenes I shouldn't access. Models are corrupted.""

They sent me 150 Wyrmite, telling me they would investigate further. I took a break- Was I... Sweating? Nervous? In a sudden panic, I decide enough is enough. I delete the app. A summer banner had came out in Feh- I hadn't played Feh for a long time. And yet, after the... Freaky incidents plaguing my life, I could use a distraction.

I open the game. Was someone..? I go to the window- Nobody is outside. But somebody was outside- I can see it, just barely along the sidewalk. Footsteps? I go to open the windo for a better look, and am distracted by my phone- Chills go down my spine as I listen to the sweet, innocent tune.

It's Dragalia lost- I don't understand, I deleted the game- And as I grab my phone, I drop it in horror. The loading screens had always been badly corrupted, but it always felt silly, if off-putting. And as I stared at the blood shot eyes and the familiar characters, hanging from thin ropes, I knew this corruption was not a silly error.

It was intentional- Menacing. It had to be- There was no other explanation. I pickup my phone it's moist I drop it my hands are red the screen isleaking it's leaking red and I hEaR fOOTspeps FoTStTepS Is thIs BL0d It is Warm sO WaRm I OPen The DOor And finD a KnIfe A GiFT frOm The DEV TeaM I PulLed a KNife Unit I aM the KNifE UnIT-

All is red now, as I slowly slip into a happy sleep. With my last strength and sanity, I go to pull one last time. I spend the 150 Wyrmite the Dev team had given me- And what unit would I get..?

I am greeted by myself on the other side of the screen, the knife buried in the chibi's model a perfect mirror of the wound I inflicted on myself... My battery is... So... Low.

Gains Psychic sensitivity as a bonus feat, adds Psychic Adept and Psychic Disciple to Monk Bonus feats. Gains All Knowledge, Spellcraft and Linguistics as Class skills and gets bonuses to the DC of anything ""Monk Related"" (Such as a regular stunning fist, or Monk style feats) and Spells cast via the Psychic Discipline if he passes a Knowledge check to identify his enemy. At high, end game levels can learn Up to third level spells Via Psychic Discipline, can cast those spells through his ""Status"" tag, use Ki to get bonuses in Psychic Duels & on INT checks, Maintain ""tags"" equal to his INT modifier, and at level 20 he becomes Immune to mind effecting effects, Stops aging and can burn Ki to make a status tag permanent (Until the creature dies, doesn't count against his limit of tags)

I can say that this specific build Is possibly one of the most fun builds I have played. Riding a Huge Sized Dire Bat is fun enough, but it's even funner squishing the mount into places it shouldn't be. One of my Favorite Party Tricks involves carrying a Basic Treasure Chest on your mount.   


To set up an ambush, take the Treasure Chest off, and squeeze into the treasure chest (With the compression ability, a Huge sized creature can fit in if they can pass a DC 30 Escape Artist check: An animal companion can hit this with Skill Focus, slick barding, ext)  


Then, when a patrolling guard, Thief or Adventurer notices a chest somewhere odd, naturally they investigate. Little do they realize they are about to get a face full of Exploding Dire Bat!

It's secret power is when you kill a boss, but due to Adds, environmental hazards, or time constraints you might have to leave the boss without looting him- With Cut your Losses, never leave a Boss behind!

It's one of my groups new favorites. Monks can easily get pretty good acrobatics checks to jump, and if you cut the DC's for jumping vertically down to something more reasonable... Your Monk can go practically anywhere they want.

Just think! The Bad guys have you cornered. They grin- After all, an Archer is ""dead"" the moment they are cornered in melee. But, to their surprise, you anime jump on to a distant wall 30 feet high, and continue shooting them as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.

But, he will stay with the party. Travel can wait until depts are paid, and working with Adventurers tend to lead one to strange and unusual places anyway. So Steve stays, occasionally asking questions about distant lands.

Maybe you can have brief ""Vacations"" in between plot elements, where the party does follow Steve's requests.

3088,blushbunnyx,BPD,ISFJ,"This made me so sad to read :(

My mom has BPD and I spent ten years of my young teenage/adult life trying to help her. Trying to convince her people DONT hate her. That if she was just nice and open with people that she could maintain friendships, get along with her family, and not always feel like an outcast. She never got it, she instead just lashed out at me for not supporting her mood shifts and constant new opinions on her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. I was ‚Äúminimizing‚Äù the situation for her in trying to help her.

This sentence you wrote really struck a cord: 
‚ÄúI worry I‚Äôll have children just so there is someone else to give me love‚Äù. I believe my mom did this sadly. When I was around 14 I remember her coming into my room and crying stating ‚Äúall my kids do is take take take and give nothing in return‚Äù (we were ages 14, 12, and 9 at the time). I felt guilty for being alive, but then remembered she choose to have kids; it was all very confusing. I think she was happy when we were small (all under age 10). Her emotional outbursts were minimal (unless I was oblivious) but I don‚Äôt remember. I think she was content during those years bc she finally felt like she had a clear identity: she was mom of three small children/babies who needed her and provided unconditional love to her. We chose her over others (natural parental attachment) and this made her feel special. Once we grew up and started to have our own opinions on the world, become independent....she struggled with this greatly. This is when things got really bad for me. 

If it makes you feel any better, none of us have BPD. However I have severe anxiety and was depressed and suicidal for a while due to her. Your awareness of your flaws (everyone has flaws) and how you interact with others is huge. She never took responsibility for anything and said it was everyone else‚Äôs fault. 


You articulating FP.....wow. My mom used to use that phrase verbatim to refer to this friend she idolized. But as with every friendship, she loved them one moment and then was skeptical/mistrusting of them the next. She can‚Äôt maintain friendships. 

Thank you for giving me a glimpse of what goes on in the head of someone with BPD. It makes me so sad to think how my mom struggles internally, but never articulated. I had to break off contact with her for my own health and sanity a couple years ago...and she hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since. "
3089,blushbunnyx,BDSMcommunity,ISFJ,"My mother has BPD and knowing what I know about it, open relationships sound like a DISASTER for them. I suppose it‚Äôs not all one-size-fits-all, but I know that people with BPD really struggle with abandonment issues and self confidence/worth/identity. I personally feel like it would be really hard for someone with BPD to accept that their partner was seeing other people and not take that personally. 

But who knows! Only you ultimately can determine if it‚Äôs right for you. It‚Äôs not right for a lot of people, regardless of mental health issues. So don‚Äôt pressure yourself to be all for it if it doesn‚Äôt feel right."

- don‚Äôt be afraid to chat with people before meeting them. Getting to know a little bit about them and their vanilla interests (as well as kink interests) helps to see if you guys will match up 
- use Kik (an alternate messaging app that makes it easier to communicate) with them when you feel comfortable and share pictures of each other, espec face, to see if there is physical attraction 
- meet up in a public place to get to know them

- don‚Äôt let them take control of you right away. They aren‚Äôt your master UNTIL YOU ASK THEM TO BE. Many dominants on Fet simply don‚Äôt understand that. They have no power over you until you choose to give yourself over. This does not mean you are any less submissive, or of a kitten etc. 
- take your time and ease into things so you feel more comfortable and don‚Äôt feel taken advantage of. 

Be gentle with yourself and ease into it at a pace that‚Äôs comfortable for you. The right master will understand this and respect it. 

Good luck!! Xx"
3092,blushbunnyx,raisedbyborderlines,ISFJ,"Hey, it‚Äôs okay to feel that way. I [25F] felt that way for a long long time, struggling with my severe social anxiety and depression after years of emotional abuse from my uBPD mom. My mom was highly functioning, intelligent and in her ‚Äúgood‚Äù moments wanted us kids to go to excellent universities and have great careers. I always wanted to be a physician. But the mental issues became too much, I couldn‚Äôt even function at my college. I‚Äôd have panic attacks and meltdowns that interfered with my grades, my ability to approach professors for help. Not only did I have to deal with my mother beating me down to a pulp for so many years, but also I felt like shit about myself. I wanted to just disintegrate into nothing. I felt like a burden, unlovable, ugly, stupid. No one liked me, I was weird, looked mean. These are all things **she** engrained in my head. 

I‚Äôd look around me and think ‚Äúomg everyone has it so fucking easy. Their parents are just supportive, while I have a psychopath mother to deal with on top of my insanely difficult studies and a father who doesn‚Äôt speak to me‚Äù (my mom actually alienated me away from him bc claiming he was evil, and my dad in hindsight couldn‚Äôt deal with her BPD enough to save me from her. They were divorced since I was 4). 

I used to have a lot of built up anger too. And in some ways I am still bitter that I couldn‚Äôt have focused on myself enough as a teenager and young adult that I could have pursued the career of my dreams. But I‚Äôve really just let go and focused on these things instead: 
‚ÄîStopped talking with my mom (NC 3 years now....which is **crazy** to think about) 
‚ÄîGot on an SSRI
‚ÄîFound an amazing therapist
‚ÄîReconnected with my dad (who I love to death and who I have come to realize is exactly like me). 
‚Äîfound the amazing power of exercise, healthy food and meditation 
‚Äîfocused on being the best person I could be 

All these things helped me feel WHOLE. I really did some self reflection about what I wanted in life, and now am on a great career path that is just as good, if not better, than a physician. 

You‚Äôll get past it, but you really just have to *let it go*. You can‚Äôt change the past and you can‚Äôt change the experience you had. Accept it and recognize that you have now have immense awareness of right and wrong after having to deal with a BPD individual. There are strengths that you got from that experience. You made it through. "
3093,blushbunnyx,raisedbyborderlines,ISFJ,"Hi there, 

Ugh I [25F] know how it feels. I‚Äôve been NC with my uBPD mom for three years now, and actually it was her who eventually decided to ‚Äúdisown‚Äù me bc I had left her with **no choice** (sigh, the drama of the BPD). This was after years of me saying I had had enough, I just couldn‚Äôt take the emotional roller coaster anymore. I had no idea how to tell her that but more so STICK to that and not let her creep back in, or let my guilt in wondering if she is okay get the best of me. 

I like you was her best friend, her therapist, her everything. While she shat on me for not ‚Äúappreciating‚Äù her enough (somehow), being a selfish and narcissistic asshole, being not compassionate and an **ugly** person (yes she actually spent like two full minutes one time screaming that I was ugly, like to my core). She‚Äôd say things to me like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your kicking dog‚Äù, and screaming over and over ‚ÄúI‚Äôm human, my feelings matter‚Äù 

Anyways...she had given me this ultimatum that I was not to speak to her family members (my aunt and grandmother) bc my mom deemed the people as ‚Äúevil‚Äù for some things they may or may not have done when she was a child. At this point, I don‚Äôt even care if anything did happen to her. And I never knew what to believe either bc she would lie straight to my face about things I has supposedly ‚Äúdone‚Äù to her. She found out (by looking at my phone records) that I was in contact with them and decided that I was a toxic person for doing that. I had to speak to my family, who I loved very much, in hiding for many years as not to piss my mom off. 

She sent me this email, titled ‚Äúindependence‚Äù when I was 22: 

*I am hurt that you would want to have a relationship with ‚Äî- since she committed assault and battery against me by punching me in the face 3 years ago; at the same time, with her parents, she also verbally abused me in front of your brothers for 20 minutes at my uncle's funeral after-party, including screaming such vile statements such as ""everyone cannot wait to see you in a casket."" That incident, together with her parents'--my sister and her husband-- assault on my brother the same day (because we both gave a 3 minute speech about our uncle/ my godfather), their acting as witness against me in court proceedings before that, and their brutal¬†treatment of my brother's family, has¬†led me to have no contact with them. ¬†

More than that, though, I am tired of your belittling statements and your need to text ‚Äî-[my best friend] with a seeming play by play of most of our encounters while we are together. In light of my life-long devotion to you, your lack of respect for me makes me very sad. ¬†

Lastly, because of your age and recent comments about your acquaintances paying their own bills I think that it is best for you to be financially independent. I have contacted Verizon and authorized you to take your phone number and start a new personal account for yourself. You have three weeks to do that.

Mom*



After that message I knew‚Äîthat‚Äôs it. I knew it was out of my hands. Her disowning me, as she had threatened for like the past year, was inevitable. 

She said nothing to me until three months later when I got this follow up email titled ‚Äútruth‚Äù  

*Dear ‚Äî,

I hope you are doing well.¬†I am writing to ask you to please not repeat lies that my sister tells you about me, e.g., that I had an affair when married to your father. Spreading my sister's rumor is slander because it is a false statement.

Interestingly enough though, my mother has several affairs that she told me about while she was married to Joe: two¬†sexual affairs with co-workers at Tek Coating And a sexual affair with Gaile Mooradian's husband, Jack Mooradian. I think you know Gail--she is Nana's first cousin and my godmother. Gail is the one whose daughter Cindy was killed in the car accident. Cindy's death came a bit BEFORE my mother's affair with Jack, surely while Gail was in a state of depression.¬†When my mother was married to my Dad he shoved her in our kitchen when I was 12 because she was (at least) giving Joe Sacoco free cartons of cigarettes from my father's business (she left my dad for Joe).

Certain types of people project onto others what they themselves have done. It seems that that is the case here. If you have shared Dianne's lie with anyone else please¬†straighten out facts from fiction with your companions, friends, and others who now may have a false impression. ¬†

I remain your proud parent who devoted 22+ years to helping you, ¬†and your brothers, in every conceivable way, to lead a prosperous life. ¬†

Mom*

I guess I put all this out there to say that it‚Äôs hard to get away. And the only way I was able to was to do something that she considered so wrong that she didn‚Äôt want me around. "

3096,118arcane,OutOfTheLoop,INTJ,"Answer: My assessment of the situation is as follows: She was going through a rather disturbing time in reference to mental health issues and possibly drug abuse as a result. 

After looking through her videos I noticed a disturbing amount of sudden weight loss and difference in presentation. I posted it [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/5TOdJmN). 

I think that because I do not know her personally, it is obviously not my place to diagnose her, but her facial expressions are of a quality that remind me of people I‚Äôve known to have schizophrenia and type II bipolar disorder. She could be going through a manic or schizophrenic episode, which are commonly first triggered in one‚Äôs late adolescence and young adulthood. 

This would explain why she was clearly on drugs or extremely manic in earlier videos, unable to speak coherently to her audience and repeating herself. If she is abusing drugs, it would reference her immensely sudden 30+ pound weight loss. It also fits extremely well into the idea of an episode of mania, as previously mentioned, where the sufferers usually engage in reckless behaviour, including drug abuse and disappearances. 

I think that what her boyfriend said about being in a professional setting in order to receive help is plausible, actually, and there is no evidence to support the hypothesis he is kidnapping her or something. In fact, it‚Äôs probably just speculation triggered by all the other events going on in the world right now. The fact is: she‚Äôs in the UK and the laws are very different from America, where the missing persons report would have been handled differently. 

It is likely she is simply receiving a notable amount of treatment for her mental health and possibly drug abuse issues. Don‚Äôt make mountains out of molehills. This happens all the time with sufferers of debilitating mental illnesses."
3097,118arcane,iamatotalpieceofshit,INTJ,"More like ""allowed to kill the fetus but not ruin a conscious human life by causing birth defects."""
3098,118arcane,OutOfTheLoop,INTJ,"That‚Äôs what is very intriguing to me. I don‚Äôt know the exact protocols of the UK but considering how thorough the investigation would be... there was obviously a level of impulsivity in the situation. If she were to go for treatment, you would assume she would tell people. That is why I think she may have a serious mental disorder as well. People with schizophrenia are specifically apprehensive to speaking to police and people of authority for their fears. That‚Äôs just one possible explanation, however.

I think there are two possible explanations for his behaviour:
1. He is genuinely trying to shut down the situation and is replying to people in order to ensure he doesn‚Äôt look like he‚Äôs avoiding questions. People are going into it with a fixed mindset (that he is kidnapping her or something) so they are seeing it differently.
2. He genuinely has taken part in whatever has happened to her, whether it is by her own doing or his, and that‚Äôs why he is acting suspicious. 
3. This is all a hoax lol (least likely but it‚Äôs odd enough to consider that I had to post it. Edit: plus, then the police couldn‚Äôt have been involved at all)

My only problem with that is: anyone with a reasonable amount of rationality would realise that if she doesn‚Äôt come back, it makes him look like a liar. If he‚Äôs a liar, everyone would target him and his reputation would be ruined, as it would confirm the suspicion that he isn‚Äôt being truthful. If she does come back and doesn‚Äôt explain what happened, then it‚Äôs still up for interpretation forever, and it‚Äôs likely that she just doesn‚Äôt want to tell the world dark aspects of her life. 

Let me know what you think."
3099,118arcane,OutOfTheLoop,INTJ,"I agree with your assessment completely. This is logically incongruent and I am bothered by it. I wonder if the ""professional"" help she is receiving is truly professional, or she is elsewhere attempting to receive a treatment if that is still the case. I doubt she is in a formal rehabilitation centre if no additional information is provided from a facility. 

Regardless, in any case whatsoever the authorities should investigate every individual who is in a close relationship with the missing person. If he isn't investigated there is something seriously biased in this situation."
3100,118arcane,misanthropy,INTJ,"People are mean to me because I'm not afraid to be completely honest about myself. I have a healthy amount of self-esteem and refuse to cut myself down a few levels for other people. 

This makes them uncomfortable, because they're used to people in my generation, and in general, having depression, low self-esteem, being insecure, and downplaying every aspect of their existence. They also expect people to lie to them so they can feel better about their own lives. 

As a result, people might get offended or think I'm arrogant by comparison, even though, in fact, I'm very aware of my current limitations and faults. I simply choose not to talk about them to other people unless someone were to ask me. 

I know who I am and what I want to be, and no one's opinion affects that for a notable amount of time."

So the brain,in order to adjust will regulate by controlling or even stop the dopamine factory .(Meth is infamously known for that.and a significant amount of the damage inflicted upon the reward system is irreversible.they will litteraly never be happy again.)

Of course,healthy people who draw pleasure from multiple sources (achievements/reliantionships/food...) Don't put all their eggs in the same basket.

They would rather fight something they know then something where all bets are on.

Nobody can affirm any thing,the levels of nicotine available are unheard of.

Vapers who smoked for decades say the juul is way more potent then the greasiest rolled up cig ever.

Are They better off with this crippling addiction now ?

You can argue yes you can argue no.

Its not all about lung cancer when you want to speak harm reduction.
The long term cost of an early life addiction in many cases ends up having heavier concequences then a 71years old chainsmoker dying from tobacco related disease.

A lot of kids got addicted to the juul even though they would have never smoked a cigarette had vaping never existed.

3165,-Chatsky-,Drugs,INFJ,"That‚Äôs fantastic ! I‚Äôm really glad you are figuring things out for yourself :) 

I‚Äôm in a somewhat similar situations... during the last 12 months or so I‚Äôve been doing different drugs but after I did lsd for the first time in July my mindset has started to change... i am now off almost everything (including alcohol) except for weed which I also want to give up... I spent a lot of time on self reflection and analysing my behaviour / thinking and came to some solid conclusions. I did trip again for second time after that to really let those conclusions sink in. 

Most importantly I realise that I don‚Äôt love and accept myself. Because of that I am always hard on myself and burn myself out from my perfectionism. Because I don‚Äôt love myself I am not really capable of loving others as I can be hard on them too. 

This is my motto now - ‚ÄúLove yourself and love others‚Äù. I‚Äôve been meditating daily for over 3 months now, got more into Buddhism and just started to try to be more like myself in as many situations as I can. Most importantly be kind to myself and others. It‚Äôs not always easy, I am still judging myself for a lot of things but at least I‚Äôve become more mindful of that

All the best to you on your beautiful journey ! Sometimes I‚Äôm wondering if LSD was a mistake... I think not. It opened my eyes to some truths that I would otherwise come to much later or maybe even never. And to see that truth can be painful, you go through paradigm shift and that come come with depression but I know deep inside it‚Äôs temporary - just part of my journey "

3169,-Chatsky-,LSDTripLifeHacks,INFJ,You might become really out of touch with reality (psychological repercussions) and also exhaust yourself physically especially if you‚Äôre not eating / sleeping as you normally do.

3172,-Chatsky-,Meditation,INFJ,"Oh my god I had the same experience in September when I was in Sri Lanka... I sat ‚Äòinside‚Äô this massive tree meditating and when I started doing loving kindness the wind got stronger and stronger to the point that suddenly I was filled with bliss, with love for myself and for everything else - the tree, the wind, the people around me. I didn‚Äôt feel separate from any of them, it all felt like one. I had tears of joy running down my face, being grateful for being shown what true love and bliss are and I promised to never forget this moment and to take this experience into my real life, treat everyone with kindness and love all beings!

It's definitely the novelty of getting someone so angry, and seeing them react. It's hilarious to the troll when someone gets in a huge fit. The trolls (the less evil ones) just like to stir up trouble and cause a bit of malice. They see it as nothing more than some sort of comedy.

Personally, I dont think it has to be an ‚Äúeither/or‚Äù question. But I do subscribe more to meaning trumping happiness, and for happiness being a gift to be grateful."

You're still inhabiting a living organism (your body) that has survival instincts. This is what feeling them feels like. It's natural.

3246,HeartOfSky,Psychonaut,INFJ,"i disagree, to a certain extent. it's not just that they show you how you can change your life, they give you access to parts of your psyche that may have been otherwise inaccessible.

I took them, and still take them, to do exactly what you warned against... to fix my life problems. And... you know what? It's worked better than anything else. I am the happiest I've ever been in my entire life. I'm connecting more deeply with people. The quality of my work has improved by exponentially, and... now that the emotional work is done... LSD is helping me to repattern my neurology while simultaneously opening up flexibility within my body, which I've never had before.

The thing is, when it comes to using psychedelics to fix life problems... they're not for amateurs. Most will need a therapeutic guide."
3250,HeartOfSky,Psychonaut,INFJ,"I concur.

Have a friend who's terrified of trying psychs. Doesn't want a ""bad trip"". What he doesn't realize is that her waking life IS a bad trip. The psych will just point that out a bit more loudly and then say: ""Um... DO something about it."" :P"

Deck: P.E.K.K.A, rage, 3 musketeers, elixir collector, skeletons, fire spirits, mini P.E.K.K.A, zap.

Deck guide: Pump up at the beginning, and cycle with fire spirits, zap, skeletons, and mini pekka. Mini pekka and skeletons will be especially important for defense. In double elixir time, use pekka for defense and counter push with 3 musketeers, rage, and possibly fire spirits. Mini pekka and fire spirits is a potential counter push for single elixir time, although not the main goal of the deck."

Creativity is a whole-brain process involving the cortex, hippocampus, and many other areas. Adenosine and GABA will inhibit all of them.

I have spoken Japanese my entire life. It is one of my mother tongues. I saw the character for thousands of times. I did not connect it to mindfulness.

I may get a tattoo of this character, haha.

I wondered what character would embody ‚Äúmindfulness.‚Äù 

Zen (ÂñÑ) does not cut it. The character means ‚Äúgoodness.‚Äù The Buddhist connotation is esoteric.

Ima (‰ªä) sounded common. Genzai (ÁèæÂú®) has two characters.

Note that nen (Âøµ) itself is rarely used in Japanese. It signifies abstract concepts combined with other characters.

ÂøµÈ°ò (nengan): wish (thought + want)

Âøµ‰ªè (nenbutsu): prayer to Buddha (thought + Buddha)

ÁêÜÂøµ (rinen): ideology (reason + thought)

‰ø°Âøµ (shin‚Äônen): conviction (belief + thought)

ÊÉ≥Âøµ (s≈çnen): idea (thought + thought)

I do not like tattoos. I am prudent about my body. But that character on the skin above my heart would remind me to be present."

3343,Soul-Watcher-8,therapy,INFJ,"They are in their thirties and they act that way? Allow me to analyze their souls. They are not doing well with their lives. They are not satisfied with their lives. They are stressed out. This kind of people provoke other people to see their reactions because it energizes them. They didn‚Äôt really think you look like a terrorist. They said that to see your reactions. The best way to deal with these people is to show no emotions or reactions and to walk away.

They would have asked a gay man what a man‚Äôs penis tastes like.

They would have said to a feminist that abortion is murder.

They have no beliefs. Everything they say is what they think would get a rile out of you.

You didn‚Äôt give them any response which was the right thing to do. They were disappointed and thought, ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt react to it. How boring.‚Äù

But you are hurt. Then you are letting them manipulate you. I know it is hard but calm your emotions and force yourself to feel better. Forcing yourself is not advisable but in this case, you need it. Realize they weren‚Äôt psychologically healthy people. Declare that you will not let their unstable minds disturb your inner peace. Pity them that they must have distorted lives that their minds have to act this way to cope.

Then let it go. You have more important things. Your grades, career, family, friendships, etc. These men do not deserve a place in your mind!"

Show your virtues that negate the narcissist‚Äôs lies.

If the narcissist says you are selfish, be kind. 

It is not showing off. It is not defending yourself. It is shining above the narcissist‚Äôs tricks.

But make sure people see it. People cannot consider your virtues if they don‚Äôt see them. 

People will realize the narcissist is lying. The narcissist will deflate and disappear."

I had an argument with my brother which would have exploded into a full-blown fight in the past. I handled the situation really well. I drew my daily card late at night. I met the King of Cups, someone who masters his own emotions. The experience sent chills down my spine. 

I have also been doing my best to be more productive. I am seeing Pentacles, especially the Eight of Pentacles. They seem to promise me success given that I continue to work hard. 

I rarely draw the cards these days (because I don‚Äôt want to bother the universe) but these messages stay with me and motivate me."
3347,Soul-Watcher-8,Mindfulness,INFJ,"If a Japanese person sees *nen* on your body, the impression they get is similar to what you would feel when you see a tattoo that says *SENSUS* in Latin. 

You do not know what it means but you guess its meaning because you know the English word ‚Äúsense‚Äù which came from the Latin word.

The Japanese person will not connect the tattoo to mindfulness because they don‚Äôt know the etymology of the character. But if *you* make the connection, the tattoo will serve its purpose."

‚ÄúWhen people complain about not being represented enough compared to the people of topic of interest, aren‚Äôt they just ‚Äúall lives mattering‚Äù the original cause?‚Äù

The struggles Demi people encounter on a day-to-day basis are laughably minor when compared to how many people have been bullied into killing themselves, have been denied a job, or have been abused for existing.

Even when bi people complain during this time of year about not getting as much representation as trans, I have to eye-roll. It‚Äôs almost like the people who are presently the most affected by politics get more media attention. Not hating, that‚Äôs just how it is.

There's always a moment when it feels right, just go with the damn flow. Goddamn it. These posts trigger me. Like, just be a human and stop overthinking. And I don't mean just you, I mean you, your friends who are assholes for peer pressuring you and your damn date who's whining about not kissing when she could be the one initiating it.

Also, you're both fucking grown ups. Act as such. Communicate and be confident."

Also, since you have been in the shoes of both RDs and MDs (who have different priorities), how would we bridge any gaps and facilitate communication to maximize quality in patient care? I'd definitely love to hear how we can help MDs  (and vice versa) to meet common goals.

I thought it was a photograph from the preview icon (it looks extremely realistic because the color scheme resembles the natural world).

Normally, the black on the clouds would bother me, because it would muddy the whole thing, but for some reason, it just works here. Also, I know you used paint, but it looks like pastel.

3387,Violentcell,HumanMicrobiome,INFP,"Unfortunately, it seems that the keto diet can cause kidney stones, although using potassium citrate can help prevent them ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17621514](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17621514)). The way I see it, a low-carb/ketogenic diet removes any substrates that the bacteria use to grow. It makes sense to ""starve"" them to death.

Another factor that I think is just as important, is the removal of excessive sugars that cause high levels of insulin in the blood. The lack of jagged sugar spikes leads to a stability of blood glucose levels that also help control inflammation, which can also affect the gut flora (which can then help control inflammation). Excessive carbohydrate intake also plays a role in inflammation (via cellular glycation).

It's all tied together.  All these chronic health issues like heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, ect., are tied to high inflammatory states, excessive weight from an excess of macronutrients, and gut permeability. I do believe a lower-carb diet, as opposed to the diet we are advised to eat (45-60% kcals from carbohydrates) can definitely help some people achieve better health."

3389,Violentcell,learnart,INFP,"It's super realistic and nicely done! The color choice makes it pop out, and the shadows are where they should be.

One thing that stood out to me though, were some of the lines. Some lines (like where the snout curves, where the base of the mouth starts from the water, the whole right cheek area) are too obvious and take away from the realism that you did achieve in other areas (like literally right next to it, at the base), where you don't have lines, but gradual variations in color. Also, the water has a slight, soft, velvet look to it because it's too smooth. Other than that, it's great!"
3390,Violentcell,learnart,INFP,"I agree with the other posts, very well done OP! Very clean technique!

In all honesty, the drawing itself makes me feel a bit anxious though...which is a positive because good art makes you feel something :) 

If I try to analyze the emotional reaction, it may be due to the jagged, sharp edges which resemble cold, broken glass, as well as the color, which is a cool blue-green, a color that lacks warmth, and when combined with the edges, takes away any soothing quality it may have. The figure seems to have its mouth closed, in which in this case, the deduction is self-explanatory.

Oh yeah you can't eat either. And your only form of entertainment is Reddit. And to worsen your agitation your force fed satan brand Adderall. But only every other day.

I just haven't been feeling right at all. Everything's been a bit of a blur.  Oddly enough i had something similar last year that lasted from late July to early October.

3536,witty_thinking,Enneagram,ISTJ,"I'll quote this from a very knowledgeable source, though it does not talk about the 5:


>I‚Äôm going to use this as an opportunity to talk briefly about the enneagram.


>Your core is visible and important and serves as a constant motivator.


>Your wing is like‚Ä¶a gentle brake on the core. You probably don‚Äôt relate to it much as it‚Äôs a counterbalance. It modifies the core. It is meaningless without that context.


>If we are seeing the core as a bike and the wing as a gentle brake, the first fix is like, the bike light or panniers - a valuable asset but not critical to the driving, and the second fix is like those plastic handlebar tassels that contribute to the overall appearance of the bike somewhat but they are not at all necessary to understand the concept of a bike.


>Anyway with that in mind: if you‚Äôre a 2, you will primarily be motivated by 2 things and the 1 or 3 wing are just going to modify 2. You are not, as a person, going to see a significant influence from 1 or 3 (unless you have a 1 fix, in which case you will be motivated by 1 a much smaller amount than you are by 2). A 2 wants to be loved and does things for others because their fear is that they will not be loved, whether or not they have a 1 or 3 wing. A 2w1 will have a little bit of an underlying sense of ‚Äúit is my moral duty to be helpful‚Äù vs. a 2w3 who will have more of an attitude of ‚Äúit is valuable to be helpful‚Äù but the main thing a 2 is interested in is still being helpful, not being a perfectionist or impressive."

After a few days, suddenly Rei asked about Yan-bo and Karnulla relationships (daily talks). The choices were between ""It's Yan-bo's fault"" or ""it's just like us"". I answered the latter. Rei answered ""So, are we enemies?"" (or something like that, I kinda forgot, sorry...). Then, she talked about our current relationship and asked about whether it can be fixed or not. The choices were ""It depends on you"" and ""No"". I answered ""No"" lol. After that, she suddenly talked about this ""different ending"" from ""theirs"". I mean, who are ""they""?? Are ""they"" the other watchers? Also, did Rayark mentioned anything about possible multiple endings?

By the way, sorry that the stupid me didn't screenshot the whole conversation. If I get the same conversation again, I'll definitely give an update and recap the whole thing. Or maybe if anyone else had the same conversation, feel free to share (my memory isn't just that reliable lol).

UPDATE: FALSE ALARM. ""Theirs"" means Yan-bo and Karnulla. At the last part, Rei said ""Although Yan-bo and Karnulla can't get along, I still hold out hope that our ending would be different than theirs."". Yup, I'm a braindead."

""It's just been so long.""

""We haven't spoken for some time...""

""Just feel a little awkward, that's all.""

""But, if you've already decided how you feel, then it doesn't really matter what I say.""

Branch 2: ""So you know how I feel, don't you?"" / ""Don't try to evade the question"". Again, second.

""......then, what do you mean by partners?""

""Do you mean someone who has the same goal as you? Or is it someone who thinks about what's best for you? Despite you never asking for them to do so.""

""....yes, I understand. You still don't have the answer.""

Therefore, asking for a definitive answer... I don't think it's fair of you to demand that of me.""

Branch 3: look at the image.

""Ah...I...""

""I've never seen you so angry at me before...""

""I think that since we're always together... there's no way to clear out our emotions.""

""They build and build until they turn into daggers to be used against each other.""

3689,ThyShall,badminton,ENFJ,"I have both racquets.
The 88d used by gideon is a little longer and works best when your grip is all the way down low for smashing and controlling. Itll be hard to intercept shots at the front since youll be holding it down low.

The reason i hold it down low is because the 88d is not beginning friendly in my experience. If you hit the shuttle a little to the right or left of the sweet spot, a weak shot is bound to put you at disadvantage, so the individual must be consistent. The 88skill however is a stiff racquet and feels light when swung, but remains to be average at best when trying to pressure opponents from the back of the court. With the 88d, lots of practice will be needed to get used to it, but when you do, it will pay dividends because it is lighter weight and gives you a cannon of a smash, meaning you save energy and also have a big smash.

The z force is also an advanced racquet but in a different aspect. At first try, the zf2 will feel great, the smash feels solid and big swings i.e. lifts and clears will feel awesome. However, that will all it will amount to. The reason being the sweet spot is enlarged with isometric shape. 

The downside of this racquet will be the smaller frame and head heavy effect. In doubles, more driving and fast paced smashing and defending will occur. Play will involve quick racquet skills and movement of racquet to divert smashes. High lifts for zf2 to smash will be great but dont be fooled because when it comes to driving, you may have trouble connecting shots UNLESS you have a monster forearm power. Many singles players used to used 4u and 3u zf2, but recently, racquets have been designed specifically for doubles and singles play. Although some still use zf2 in dpubles, i believe they use it only because they have been using it since they were little or for a very long time. 
"
3690,ThyShall,selfimprovement,ENFJ,"Perfect. I couldnt agree more. The fact that others stay to themselves are because they are bound with convictions established through cuddling up to their knees. 

They dont want the attention, but at the same time needs it to maintain an identity. So before you talk to someone, let them know where you are standing, are you there as company, a talk as a co-worker, to build a professional relationship, seeking advice, as a teacher? 
This is effectively small talk and anyone who feels as if small talking is the downfall of human interaction, you couldn't be any further from the truth. 

Therefore, if you are seeking to build relationships, dont put the weight of humiliation on them, but offer to be the one who takes the uncomfortable and warm foundation for them to rest on. Relax. 

You do, indeed, reap what you sow. "

Another idea. What if you have a few hundred index cards with different random phrases in them. Pick one randomly, leaving it facing up on the nightstand next to you but don‚Äôt look at it at all so you don‚Äôt know what it says. Read the card while astral projecting, and confirm if you‚Äôre correct when you wake up. 

Could use something like cards against humanity to make it more interesting lol.

Of course, this is all still word of mouth. Anyone could say, ‚ÄúI saw the name of a card in the astral plane and saw that it was right, I swear!!‚Äù The real way to prove astral projection would be to get someone else besides the APer to have the card laying out on a table in their locked bedroom, with the actual wording (or picture/color) of the card only being known by the person who is not astral projecting."

I loved the idea of remembering all of the things I used to do that I know I‚Äôll forget about, so I decided to make daily journaling a habit. What I didn‚Äôt expect though, is the great release I get from journaling as well. It calms my mind and allows me to think more clearly and work through things that are bothering me. I always feel more calmed and at ease after a session of journaling. Now I am obsessed with journaling, and it‚Äôs a habit that I always intend on keeping. Journaling is honestly therapeutic for me.

Okabe is deeply conflicted to his core on this. Amadeus brings him happiness to see Kurisu, and pain from seeing Kurisu.



Slipping out of the party is, in my opinion less about him wanting to talk to amadeus instead but him wanting to ditch being around suzuha.



Remember, Suzuha for the most part hates okabe. Okabe can't look her in the eyes and basically talk to her because he knows the future he damned her to basically. He only slips out of the party to let Suzuha be, he was fine being there until Suzuha made it awkward for both of them in a way.

3830,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,"You're right, they definitely were expecting me to be a pushover. Surprise, mothafuckas!"
3831,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,"Good on you for sending that to be honest. I have my own list of bad experiences (I've had one good roommate out of six) and I got fed up as well, but instead of confrontation, I straight up just reported the current one."
3832,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,I'll have to check my lease agreement again but I don't think that applies here.
3833,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,"Yeah, this guy sits in their room playing video games all day. Also, she could have texted me and asked if he could stay before I showed up, or at least told me he was gonna be there for a few days. But it's been three days which is the visitor limit in our development, and I don't think he has a job which is probably why he got evicted. And they're engaged! How?! People really confuse me sometimes."
3834,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,"She told me face to face that he was here and when I tried to get more information she changed the subject or kept it very vague. I have no problem talking face-to-face with people. However, my last roommate was very problematic because of her love interest and I'm not willing to deal with that again considering I'm taking 18 credits and working weekends. If he wants to sit all day playing video games (not just on weekends, but on weekdays as well, for hours and hours straight) instead of getting a job to pay his rent, then he can leave. And I guarantee he's been here for longer than two days. The townhouse development has a 3 day limit on visitors."
3835,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,"We live in student housing. He is not a student here as far as I know. It's not like a normal apartment where anyone can live there, you must be a student and there are a lot more rules at play. She could have texted or called and told me he would be here for a few days (3 days is the limit here) but she didn't. She moved him in and told me when I showed up, assuming I would just let it slide. He's also not allowed to be here because he's not on the lease and he was evicted from the property before (if he DID go to this school before) meaning he probably wouldn't be welcomed back if he LEGALLY tried. When I went to the office, I told the leasing agent I thought it was just going to be me and the girl, because I thought maybe it had been a package deal all along and I didn't know. That's when I was told that he was not legally supposed to be there. Before I went to the office, I tried to ask the roommate questions about the situation and she kept it very vague, not telling me that he was evicted from the property and not saying how long he would be there. She should have communicated with me first."
3836,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,"Being a ""snitch"" is not a good reason to allow myself to deal with some bullshit. Logically, it makes more sense for me to report them. I don't know them, I don't owe them anything, and they're breaking the law, which could get me in trouble even though I haven't done anything wrong. Why would I be loyal to people like that? That's just foolish."
3837,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,"Maybe, but I'd rather be a snitch and get adequate study and sleep time than let it go and miss out on what I need. This is going to be my hardest semester yet. I need those things."
3838,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,"You're right, I didn't say anything like that. At the time I thought maybe they had signed the lease together and I just didn't know. So I went to the leasing office asking if he was supposed to be there, and then they said he wasn't. My exact words to the agent were, ""I was under the impression that it was just going to be the girl living there, but she has her fiance living there too."" I asked what the deal was and the agent said it was just supposed to be the girl and that her fiance had been evicted. She even knew the guy's first and last name and told me that other employees had reported sightings of him being there when he wasn't supposed to. Once I had this knowledge I told her I didn't want him there and she said she would send a letter."
3839,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,It wouldn't let me post it there so I had to compromise lol. I hope they wouldn't call me an asshole.
3840,felltheblackwolf,badroommates,INFJ,"(Copied from a previous reply to another user.)

I spoke with her as soon as I got there. But she should have told me he was there from the beginning, or at least asked if he could stay. (I've been living in this townhouse for a year and a half and she just moved in.) I'm aware of his video gaming habits because he competes in tournaments (which she posted on Facebook a few weeks prior to me coming back) and because today is now Tuesday and he's been playing games since I left at 9:15 this morning. She also told me to my face that he stays up late playing games most nights. I told her I'm a light sleeper, I have a packed schedule, I told her when I typically go to bed, get up, etc and that his habits should not inhibit sleep or study time. Which they absolutely will."

I mean it's a rough journey. I'm proud of my progress so far but somehow my motivation vanished completely. Thanks for your kind words anyway!"
3904,temp14y3r,MbtiTypeMe,ESTP,"Fe-Ni-Se-Ti **ENFJ**

You really value connections to people and make them feel welcome (Fe). Also a lot of ENFJs can be really quiet because of Ni in the second place. You look into people's emotions (Fe) and you feel strongly that something is wrong in people (Ni) so you can give them good experience via Se. ""I connect with people, see beauty in everything, i sing, i share myself with others, I am active, I laugh loud and lots"" also points to Se.

>I am timid, hesitant, sensitive, insecure, alwaysalways worrying about others, hostile, hard to talk to, uninterested, spaced out, pushing people away, and unproductive.

You overanalyse people's intention when you're unable to use Fe due to stress, so your Ti is weak. Your inferior Ti also explains why you might feel insecure about your own emotions when you try to analyse them."
3905,temp14y3r,MbtiTypeMe,ESTP,ESTJ (Te-Si-Ne-Fi) with very close Si-Ne strength.
3906,temp14y3r,MbtiTypeMe,ESTP,"**Here! We! Go!**

>I like learning new things but lose interest quickly once my skill level plateaus. Jack of all trades master of none, which annoys me to no end 

Ne and Se

>I do this all the time and I feel great. This is the definition of my optimal weekend. 

You need downtime to reflect yourself, indicating you have a leading introvert function (either Ti or Fi)

So we have INTP, ISTP, INFP or ISFP to choose from.

>Not exercising has negative implications for my mental health. It‚Äôs important for me to be strong and physically able.

You seem to pay attention to your inner body, so I can sense Si.

>I‚Äôm always trying to plan ahead, and all of my plans seem to have backup plans and several branches of possibilities so that I can have a response to all eventualities. That said, I seldom follow through on my plans and don‚Äôt actually ever commit to them because I‚Äôm too fond of keeping my doors open (which is at the root of my career woes). 

The first part is Ne because you enjoy exploring possibilities. Caring about backup plans means that you seek security and stability, so you have Si. But you love possibilities first before stability, so you have Ne 2nd and Si 3rd.

>The future is full of (too many) possibilities. The present is the gateway into the future. I have to do my best now to achieve my ideal (future) self. 

obvious Ne-Si

>I analyse the situation, the context, what brought me here, where I am, why I was brought here, and if appropriate, how I can get out. If I will be let out after a short period of time and don‚Äôt need to actively plan escape scenarios, I will...This is ridiculous, I have no context, why would anyone hold me in a blank, empty room against my will if they don‚Äôt harbor some sort of hostile or suspicious intentions toward me? 

Wow this is very Ti!

> Having to sell myself makes me uncomfortable. Having to sell anything. Networking. Being forced to socialize with strangers for no discernible purpose. Not being prepared enough also makes me very uncomfortable.  

Inferior Fe, wanting to get connected but unsure if you can actually do it.

>It depends on what they would like me to do. I will listen and have a strong inclination to help. They came to me in their time of need and trusted that my skills, experience, or wisdom would be able to help them. It must be that I can do something, validate this trust and strengthen our friendship? Then again, this applies to people who know me. If the request is non-specific to me and / or ridiculous / not a good investment of my resources, then I will turn it down in some non-harmful way.

Also weak Fe, you're aware of the fact you want to help people

**INTP** yay!"
3907,temp14y3r,MbtiTypeMe,ESTP,">I can say I'm **somewhat curious**. So if people do activities that I think it's fun like sport stacking, playing Jenga, ice skating, flipping bottle, freestyle football/basketball, playing fidget spinner, etc I always want to try it. Or food that I've never tried before, or places I've never visit.... **I rarely actually do it though, but I do want to try it if I get the chance (I've tried some of what I said above and I want to do it again when I get the chance)**. So my curiosity is mostly about fun activities like said above.

Being curious and eager to try different things points to Ne, so you have Ne somewhere in your function stack.

>I would create a relaxing environment where everyone don't have to be afraid of me. **I want them to treat me as their friend instead of their leader**.

&

> If I decide to help the person it's because I'm sure I can do what the person want me to do. **And helping people can make them happy so I'll feel satisfied when I can help them**. 

Clear Fe

>The past is when everything already happened. **Honestly before 2013 I almost never live in the past but after it I almost always live in the past. I can't stop feeling nostalgic.** I know I shouldn't focus on the past but what if 2013 was the best year in my life? **I want to come back to 2013 when everything was better.**  

This is Si, so you're basically strengthening Si over time. Wishing to go back and relive experiences shows Si because you feel good when you look back to the past, regardless of whether you should focus on the past or not.

>When I learn something I need a **detailed step by step** explanation of how to do it, **repetition** and clear expectations.  

This learning style is Si that is wanting to make sure you do anything correctly and perfectly.

>I'm an indecisive person. It takes a long time to make a decision because I don't want to make a wrong decision. If it's an important decision usually I won't change my mind once I made the decision. But then I see a better option and I think ""Ugh, why I didn't choose that?? I wish I haven't made this decision so I can choose that."" 

Considering many factors before making a decision to make sure nothing goes wrong is Si. So 1st Si confirmed.

>Personally my aspiration is letting go of my fears so I can live my life to the fullest and really experience things. Being more outgoing and assertive so nobody would treat me as a doormat again. I don't know what's my aspiration is professionally but for now my aspiration is getting a job (if it counts lol) 

Your fear is related to uncertainty in future ""What could go wrong?"" You want to leave comfort zone, showing your Ne development against your Si. This is clearly Ne inferior (4th).

&#x200B;

so now Ne is 4th, Si 1st and you have Fe, congrats you are an **ISFJ**!"
3908,temp14y3r,MbtiTypeMe,ESTP,"When I'm under massive stress I just become really quiet and withdraw from people. I think there's no point bashing or projecting my anger towards others because it can do more harm instead of alleviating the situation. And yes I always have problems with imagining myself even in one year's time (what job I'll take, which country I'll end up moving to). I once had a conspiracy theory that all of my friends agreed to ignore and cut out any contact with me. It's like I totally believed that they hadn't always wanted to talk to me because they thought I was socially awkward. I don't know if this has anything to do with crappy Fe+Ni combo."
3909,temp14y3r,MbtiTypeMe,ESTP,"Another thing to add, I took enneagram tests but it always shows type 7"
3910,temp14y3r,MbtiTypeMe,ESTP,Yeah this is my problem. I score high in both Se and Ti and I keep switching between ISTP and ESTP. Any more questions to distinguish between the two?
3911,temp14y3r,geoguessr,ESTP,"I don't think using outside sources is cheating, but some people do because it would either make you score way more easily, or reduce the duration of an individual game. In my opinion, even more interesting are ""techniques"" you would make use of external assistance to bring yourself from the street view to the map 'accurately'.

So you prefer outside help... how about limiting yourself to 45-50 minutes for the whole game and get less than 10 metres apart in each map? Not easy as it seems, but maybe still easy for others."

I have a suggestion: Just flair yourself ENFP, visit /r/ENFP and see if you can relate to these people. If you can, you may as well be one - which is not completely unlikely. If not, you'll be coming back confused again."
3916,Cunavaca,MbtiTypeMe,ENFJ,"I'd rather like you to be more open minded, like an actual ENFP would be. I mean, this is about you discovering who you are."
3917,Cunavaca,MbtiTypeMe,ENFJ,"Okay.... so either you know your type or you're confused? What is it?

And sorry for these questions but I need you to reflect on yourself seriously to confirm your type."
3918,Cunavaca,MbtiTypeMe,ENFJ,"Okay. It's your right to believe anything you want. I just point you towards an inconsistency in your answers and you ask to be typed multiple times, aren't you? Nobody here knows you in real life so why do you then seek external input and get touchy when your expectations aren't met?"
3919,Cunavaca,MbtiTypeMe,ENFJ,"Hey again.

Looks more like ISFP now. You're tring to give a Ne Perspective on yourself but I am missing the characteristic idea generation that comes with being an Ne-dom, especially in philosophical questions like ""Is there a point to life?"", on which someone with high Ne probably gladly presents a bunch of different possible answers that go deeper on the topic and/or goes on tangents. Only thing where I must correct myself from last time is that you very likely use Fi instead of Fe."
3920,Cunavaca,MbtiTypeMe,ENFJ,"So would you say the masses are always right because they are more? I mean I can be wrong but you don't make a point while I deliver valid reasons. Everyone is just saying: yep, P no doubt and never question it. I'm not convinced by this."

>No matter what, you aren't ""taking care of your own orgasm"" unless you're masturbating after the fact or ignoring your partner entirely. Which is what people think when you suggest they take care of it *themselves*, AKA *without their partner being part of it.* 

I also get this impression when I hear people talking about ""taking matters into your own hands"", cause it's like, if I solely wanted to take matters into my hands then I wouldn't have sex with another person... I would masturbate alone.

Plus, if I'm engaging in making sex pleasurable for the person who I'm being intimate with and making sure he's having the best experience, etc, then why wouldn't I also be deserving of having him do the same for me? *Takes two to tango.*

The grey men with QR codes represent those who consume media, who are reduced to mere husks enslaved to what the media shows.  Toward the end of the video, the astronaut finds himself lying on the ground of grey dust, detached from the media, realizing his place in the universe and the true face of the world, which, as the title suggests, is **nothing**.  Upon noticing the door, he runs toward any sign of meaning and hope in this world, only to find himself running back to the fabrications offered by the media, sitting in front of his television.  Even if his life is a meaningless lie, it's preferable to the dystopian world outside of it.  I'm sure others could tie this to a more concrete idea but this is what I came up with.

Your AR-15 wouldn't help you against a Stryker with the hatches closed, let alone an Apache helicopter or an Abrams tank. Unless you propose making Stingers and RPG-7s street-legal.

Assuming that it was legal, there is absolutely no way that a rebellion could afford the necessary equipment. A stinger, for example, costs $38,000.00 a pop. Most successful guerrilla organizations have a foreign government bankrolling and arming them them, those that don't tend to have problems; look at how quickly ISIS ran out of money. No country anyone want to be allies with is going to finance a civil war in the United States, nor would they be able to smuggle in supplies past the worlds argest navy and air force so you're fucked there.

Assuming they could miraculously afford it, they would still get mopped up because most of them won't have the training (which is a somewhat manageable problem, assuming they can attract enough veterans) or the organization (a much bigger problem) to fight effectively. And unlike the Taliban or the Viet Cong, they wouldn't have the benefit of home-field advantage.

Then I think roaming botlane / toplane is a good idea, as you can get kills and be ahead of Zed. You can also invade his jungle to get deep wards, which would be very helpful for your team.

I'd add in to that and advise OP to track his current spendings, while planning for the future ones.

Plan for the eventuality that you lose your job, build up the savings for that. (It is important since you will be in a single income household).

I took note of the comments OP made, ""my house"" ""my kids"" ""my wife is a spender"", which is why I am advising to track spendings. Most partners who don't run the household (since it's clearly his wife who runs it, with him being away for 2 weeks at a time) don't really know the actual costs associated to running a household.  

It would be important for OP to track the spendings and realise how much the wife is actually spending on herself v/s on the household/kids, because that might become an issue in the future with the whole family depending on the OP's salary.

I wouldn't go the 'forgivable' loans route.

First, you don't want to be tied down to one state - i am not a doctor but I follow a couple youtubers who are, and I learned about the process of 'matching' - you might not even get 'matched' in that specific state, or that state might not have the speciality you want to go into, etc etc.

Secondly, what if something (pray otherwise) happens, and that you can't or don't want to complete your med schooling anymore, that would leave you with a lot of debt at a high interest rate, which will for sure not be forgiven.

I don't understand why you would want to borrow the maximum amount when you don't even know if you actually need the maximum amount, only thinking about the 'forgiveness' part - that's not really smart/not thinking ahead. You should always plan for the non-perfect scenario.

How long did you guys date before getting married?

How can you be married and not know exactly why she isn't wearing her wedding band?

**Where is the communication and understanding?**

Instead of freaking out, you should have tried to dig deeper into the root cause, perhaps, as some suggested before me, your wife has never worn a ring before and she simply forgets? Perhaps she doesn't know how much it means to you? Did you have a sit down and explained it to her?

Perhaps she is still getting used to the idea of being married?

Perhaps she works somewhere that would explain that?

I never once felt any pain at all.

In terms of the operation itself, two of my wisdom teeth were pulled out full, and two were cut in half. I got to keep them! They're HUGE! I had to have them removed because I have a small jaw. The taste of blood in my mouth for a couple days after the surgery was annoying (iron tasting).

If I had to have m wisdom teeth removed again, i'd do this surgery again. My dad didn't want me to have general anaesthesia because he was scared I would never wake up, but if you go to a good hospital/clinic, there's not much you have to worry about. Of course it costs much more than a simple extraction at your regular dentist. In my country, not all dentists do wisdom teeth removal. And even those who do, won't do more than 1-2 at a time. I didn't want to prolong the recovery period and not be able to eat properly for months, so I preferred to go all in and deal with the inconveniences of recovery just once.

Prior to the surgery, I had to have my jaw x-rayed, to see where the teeth are and stuff, then book an appointment with the clinic for removal. The procedure may vary depending on where you are from.

Coast seems to have improved drastically since their dismal run at the end of summer season. The way Coast is playing now, their spot in LCS seems secure and their return will be welcomed. 

The interesting case is Curse. Their new lineup seems good enough on paper, but they may not find synergy soon enough for their relegation series. Right now, I'd take Napkins in Disguise from the NACL over Curse. This Saturday, we'll all be able to see if any of the challenger teams looks dominant. I know a lot of us are curious to see what progress Quantic has made since coming to the US. They could be another strong challenger for Curse's slot."

The cheap money from the Fed to the financial system is completely stagnant and doing nothing to boost the real economy. The only way to restart the engine of capitalism is to give money to the 99% in the form of increased wages or decreased income taxes by shifting the tax burden onto the top percent's capital gains and property. With no demand from indebted workers and no competition because of mergers, of course our globalized monopolies don't need to reinvest their profits in R&D or new production facilities."

If we put price controls on them, then we'll have lines at the few websites which manage to get their hands on increasingly rare & expensive disinformation. Simulated support isn't provided by the government, it's provided by for-profit astroturfers which have slim profit margins per post/tweet sold. Reddit makes more per upvote in ad revenue than the propagandists make in profit. The only reason the sound-bites make it sound like they have extremely high profits is because of the sheer volume of what they sell. If you sell an item which cost you $4.00 for $4.01, 140 billion times (~ number of gallons consumed per year in USA), you just made 1.4 billion dollars. However, since the big 5 oil companies are on track to make $140 billion in profits this year, they are actually making $1 per gallon in profits, not $.01. If the gummint comes in & taxes you an additional 1%, you make only $.96 per gallon!!! For the record...the so-called ""subsidies"" are actually <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/business/04bptax.html"">much higher than the subsidies for other industries.</a>

If you want extremely high propaganda prices or difficulty finding misinformation to get brainwashed, just keep fucking with the astroturfers, the think tanks, and viral marketers. At some point the profit-incentive will be gone & your fat ass (generalization) will be reading the truth. "

I'm still trying to get my head around the borrow checker and I am having problems with the ""no two mutable references at once"" rule when it comes to the `&mut self` parameter in struct methods. For example:

    #[derive(Debug)]
        struct Struct {
            x: u64
        }
    
        impl Struct {
            fn method(&mut self) {
                println!(""struct is {:?}"", self);
            }
        }

    fn test() {
        let mut x = Struct{x: 42};
        let y = &mut x;
        y.method();
        println!(""y is {:?}"", y);
    }

In the function `test()`, when calling `y.method()`, does there exist *two* mutable references to `x`? The first is `y` in scope of `test()`, the second is `self` in the `Struct::method()` scope? I'm really interested as to the semantics of why this works? Thanks!"

I am an ISTJ and a 9w8 which is uncommon for ISTJ. Istjs are typically described as perfectionists and always by the book and basically robots with a human exterior which I do not relate to. I am not a perfectionist and I am too lazy to go by the book all the time (unless it‚Äôs for a serious activity that I am unfamiliar with). However, I know for sure that I am an ISTJ because I use SiTeFiNe. 

So I would try to stay away from 16personalities because they tend to describe the types in a stereotypical, one dimensional way. So I would suggest reading up on cognitive functions and seeing which ones fit the most for you. 

Based on all of your answers on here, the way you described yourself was similar to INTJ. But I would also check out ISTJ. INTJs are more likely to be visionary and future oriented, while ISTJ tends to be more focused on daily life and makes decisions based off of what they know worked in the past.

4250,redalmondnails,femalefashionadvice,ESFP,"I'll start! I'd say about 80% of my wardrobe these days is thrifted and I've figured out some useful tips and tricks that make the hunt easier and more rewarding:

-Look through absolutely everything. Plan on spending a good couple hours in the store. You might be missing a great find by skimming through the racks. 

-Shop all sizes/sections; too-big items can have a cool slouchy fit and often items are stuck in the wrong size section anyway. Some of my best finds are from the men's section. Lots petite women find clothes in the kid's section, too.

-Going off that, try *everything* on if possible, especially if the store won't take returns

-If you're not savvy with a needle and thread and won't bother taking items to a tailor, don't buy anything that doesn't fit in a way you like. If you are, don't buy anything that will require such an extensive fix that you'll never get around to it.

-On the other hand, some simple alterations can take an item from dated to really modern and cool. I buy a lot of oversized jackets/blazers in cool 80s prints and rip the shoulder pads out to give them a more modern silhouette. 

-Learn to spot quality. If it's pilled or worn looking, pass on it. Study up on what makes a quality garment, like the cut, material, and stitching. Learn which brands are usually indicative of good quality and which aren't, and don't be afraid to google a brand you don't know. Brands aren't everything but definitely are a good starting point. I'll always pass on anything F21/H&M in the thrift store, but I'll take a second glance at something from Ann Taylor or Eileen Fisher. 

-In a similar vein, learn how good quality material (silk, cashmere, pima cotton) feels to the touch so that you can run your hand along the racks and single out the good stuff. 

-Look at care instructions. You'll want to wash it right away before wearing it. If it's dry clean only, will you bother to take it to the dry cleaner? If not, does it look like it'll hold up to a gentle hand wash? If not, don't buy something you won't even get around to washing. "

4254,redalmondnails,femalefashionadvice,ESFP,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately and what it means to buy ""investment pieces"". 

I think even classic pieces are going to change as trends do. For example, jeans and a t-shirt will always be classic. But that description is pretty generic. If you pick out even the most basic jeans and t-shirt outfit today, chances are it'll look dated in 10 years. Subtle things like the cut of jeans and the cut of the t-shirt are still going to eventually start looking dated (and then eventually come back again). Think bootcut jeans, skinny jeans, mom jeans, bell bottoms, kick flares, any type of jeans--they're all tied to a specific time and set of trends. T-shirts probably less so, but subtle changes will make a difference.

Hell, even colors and fabrics in and of themselves can be tied to a specific set of trends in time, before they've even been turned into a garment. 

This isn't to say that there aren't classics items. I would say pencil skirts, blazers, leather jackets, basic heels and flats are all classic. But there's still a lot of room for interpretation within those pieces. What color/texture/fabric/print? Details on a blazer or hardware color on a leather jacket? Round or pointed toe on shoes? 

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that trends vary so wildly that it's almost impossible to find something that's truly classic. Things that are are likely to be plain black with no detail or uniqueness in cut whatsoever. There is a place for clothes that are so neutrally basic; IMO, those are the pieces you should treat as ""investments"" because they're not going to go out of style, because they don't really *have* a style. 

Now, I say this as somebody who does a lot of thrift shopping. I have a lot of pieces that are straight out of the 80s or 90s and they look like it. It might be trendy now, it might not be. I love that look. It's just not classic because it looks like x decade's trends. 

Again, this is something that I think carefully about when I'm considering an 'investment piece'. We are all looking at clothes through the lens of current trends, whether we like it or not, whether we think we're influenced by trends or not. Even the people who are designing our clothing are influenced by (or creating) our current trends when they design what they think are classic pieces. What might look classic right now might not in x year's time. "

4256,redalmondnails,femalefashionadvice,ESFP,">(although I always love good coping-with-depression tips).

Hi friend! I have depression too. I feel a lot better when I'm keeping myself busy, seeing friends/family, getting out of the house in some way or another. Not sure if this is the case for other people with depression, but I'm a mega extrovert and being around people really helps. The hard part is actually getting out of bed and getting the motivation to do something. 

My therapist said something to me the other day that really stuck with me and I figured I'd share it with you too. I told her I didn't do something because I didn't feel like it. She told me that ""feelings shouldn't dictate our actions."" Feelings can shape how we approach problems or challenges, but ""I don't feel like it"" isn't a good enough reason to not do something.

It's helped me a lot because when I've made plans to see family or something and I'm debating canceling but the only reason for doing so is that I don't feel like it, that's not good enough. If I end up doing whatever I needed to do anyway I always feel a lot better afterward. Again, YMMV but that was a good little nugget of wisdom I wanted to share. Take care! :)"

I've seen a lot of advertising lately (geared toward pre-teens and teens, it seems like) that seems to suggest that washing your face and getting ""clean"" will rid you of all skin woes. Why perpetuate the idea that acne is caused by ""dirt"" when really, it's mostly hormones and genetics? Marketing like this makes people with acne feel like shit about themselves and encourages clear-skinned people to see acne sufferers as dirty people who don't wash their face. I wish these companies would market their products in a way that encourages a good, effective routine for acne sufferers instead of pushing the idea that drying the fuck out of your face will magically cure your skin woes. "
4259,MelodicDial,occult,INTP,"You're right, much occult literature is written in a  ""vague"" style of speaking and writing. It's generally for one of the following reasons a) to train you to *think* differently (which I think is your particular problem in this case), b) to explain the intangible, spiritual, or difficult to grasp through metaphor, or term of art, and/or c) to deliberately conceal for various reasons. 

Many of the ""you are asking the wrong question"" type answers are because of the first reason. They are trying to encourage to think beyond your current world view (which is probably, if you are like most modern beginners, some kind of scientific materialism, cartesian rationalism, or atheism). The purpose of answering questions with questions is intended to stimulate your imagination and intuitive faculties. This is a crucial first step to beginning to think like a magician, and it can't be skipped over.  Why, because yes magick heavily deals with the mind and subconscious.

The other reason, of course, why there is so much  vague information, is the usual watering down that happens when something becomes popular or trendy and fashionable. That happens in every field, on the internet.

Edit: I realized I didn't give any real practical advice what to actually do about this problem. So here is what I want you to do: 1) put down the beginner books about ""magick""- these are pretty much useless to you right now anyhow. 2) Pick up some practical books on world mythology/religion, folklore, and psychology (Carl Jung ""Man and His Symbols"" is good place to start).  After you've done this for a while and have trained yourself to start thinking through myth and symbolism a little bit, continue to stay away from the ""beginner magick books"" for now and do this instead:  
1) Start a dream journal and record your dreams every day, and start analyzing some of your personal symbols and archetypes 2) Buy a tarot deck and get used to thinking intuitively through symbol and correspondences.  Once you've followed through these steps, come back and ask again, and read through your beginner books again."

4261,MelodicDial,JordanPeterson,INTP,"It's actually a good article. Being a parent is really *tough work*. Sometimes you smile and laugh...sometimes you cry...sometimes you get mad. It's not all rainbows  and lollipops 24/7, even if ultimately it is all worth it in the end. But many people continue to have these idealized and romanticized notions of what ""motherhood"" is supposed to look like. Endlessly giving, endlessly selfless, graceful, and nurturing...but that isn't very realistic. 

 It's why JP wrote a rule about not letting your children turn into someone you don't like... because if you can't respect your children (and let them walk all over you), you might start resenting them...and if you start resenting your children, you can grow bitter, mean, cruel.. 

These kinds of unrealistic expectations are a big reason why some women may fear motherhood and  think they just aren't ""perfect"" or ""maternal enough"" to have kids."
4262,MelodicDial,Feminism,INTP,"This is actually pretty common, and I believe the reason is because sexuality is like you say, a deeply personal and individual thing. Sex has a way of tapping into our innermost subconscious thoughts and desires. If you are familiar with the term ""subspace"" you may be familiar with the different changes in consciousnesses that can occur. 

When we strongly identify as one thing, this creates a shadow, so to speak, which is essentially the opposite of everything we consciously identify as. The solution isn't to further surpress your subconscious desires, but to bring them to light,  and seek more balance in your every day life. The more confident and secure you feel in your  femininity as a whole, and the more comfortable you feel expressing that in your daily life, the less  imbalanced these subconscious desires will become. 

I think often it is the case, as feminists, we may harbor a lot of unresolved insecurities about femininity. From an early age we learn from society to think of femininity as a weakness and something that must be dominated and  overcome, in order to compete on a level playing field. That can become a complex that we  then act out in our subconscious and sexual fantasy. Whether you are finding yourself with a desire to dominate and degrade others, or to be dominated and degraded yourself. "

4264,MelodicDial,Feminism,INTP,"I think anyone who has ever worked for a time in low wage, support, or service oriented jobs can relate to this. After a while, being in a position where you are always having to wear a mask and be agreeable all day long, it can start to bleed over into other areas of your non work life and impact your self confidence/self worth and relationships."
4265,MelodicDial,Jung,INTP,"If I had to speculate, just based on my own dreams, it seems to often be the case that dream characters will take on the shape of people we know or have seen in real life. Sometimes people we may know in person, but also sometimes strangers, famous people, or characters in literature/film, etc.  It's almost as if they wear different ""faces"" or ""masks"" depending on the types of archetypes we associate most with that person/persona. 

 In other words, its likely your ""mother"" in the dream represents symbolically something you associate with a feminine or mother archetype. And since our father/mother is usually the first image of the opposite sex we inherrent as a child, this becomes a sort of ""default"" masculine/feminine image in our psyche.  

In my opinion, the father/mother archetype represents our received knowledge and wisdom that has been inherited and passed down, but not necessarily examined. The process of individuation involves beginning to see ourselves as differentiated from the mother/father image--but this is often a source of anxiety and confusion. "
4266,MelodicDial,JBPforWomen,INTP,The career *after* the baby is way easier than the baby after the career... actually yeah that makes so much sense and I find it to be true in my own experience. Sometimes I think we have it backwards.
4267,MelodicDial,JBPforWomen,INTP,">And my own theory: this is why almost every romance novel ends after the female lead decides on the man. Nothing else is shown afterwards. We readers don‚Äôt care.

Partly that is the case because romance and coming of age stories like this are for the young. They end when the protagonist finally reaches the last initiation rite and milestone into full adulthood (which traditionally for girls would have been marriage). Not a whole lot is said about life after the fact, in general. 

I can't find the video now where he talks about it, but I believe this is a theory JP has touched upon on briefly, that culturally we lack many archetypes dealing with life over the age of 30. And that this may be part of the reason why many young people today struggle to grow up.  One possible explanation is that this is about the age that many of our traditional religious, mythic, and cultural icons have died. For example, Jesus was executed at around the age of 30.  It is a bit hard to imagine now in modern times, but average life expectancy in ages past was not much beyond 30 or 40 years for many people...and many were lucky to make it out of childhood at all.  And so many of our heroic myths and stories revolve heavily around youth and coming of age.  Even now in modern times, most pop culture is heavily youth oriented and is marketed mainly to people under 25.

Also, romance novels depend on conflict and romantic tensions to work... if we want to assume the couple is happily married and together at the end (which of course we do!), then there's not much story left to tell. At least not about the romance itself. ;)"
4268,MelodicDial,tarot,INTP,"No, you should use your intuition to infer the meaning as they appear, in context of your question. The particular meaning may change and have a different nuance from reading to reading. That fluidity is what you want to eventually achieve. If your assigned meanings are too rigid, then you will start to lean too much on  literal interpretations, and not your intuition to derive meaning out of them. Pentacles will come to always signify money, etc. But that's just one layer of possible meaning. The cards are onions. They have layers. ;)

So, start by thinking of each card as a general archetype, representing a set of ideas, principles, etc.  Within each, there are lots of associated symbols, and a lot of possible applications of those ideas. 

For example, looking at the Suits. We have Wands, Cups, Swords, and Coins/Pentacles. These correspond loosely to the classical elements- Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.  The element of Fire can refer to literal physical fire, but usually doesn't. It stands for concepts like Intuition, Passion, Will, Drive,  etc. Pentacles correspond to Earth. It has associated meanings concerning the material realm, practicality, groundedness, the physical body, sensuality, work, craft, etc. The associated meaning of ""money"" comes out of that concept. But so could, say,  sex. The King of Pentacles could be a sensual, or practical hard working man, who takes care of physical needs. Or it might not be a person at all, but suggesting this quality in yourself, or in a situation. 

But for purposes of learning, if it helps you to associate each with a person or character that reminds you of these qualities, you can certainly use it. I would assign each one a figure (or several) from myths. For example, The Devil card got assigned Pan and Dionysus, to remind me of positive meanings to the card as well.

I know that seems like a non-answer but let me explain. 

The first time you ever ride a rollercoaster it is scary as hell. But if you rode that rollercoaster over and over again you would eventually become bored. This is a technique used by psychologists to treat anxiety disorders. It is called exposure therapy.

On the flip side, if you actively avoid riding a rollercoaster you train your brain into thinking that you have avoided real danger. This increases fear.

By actively exposing yourself to social situations repeatedly, you will decrease your fear. When you are less fearful you can learn social skills more effectively. When you have more social skills you are less socially awkward. 

I recommend going to a Meetup and start by being in a mode of gathering data rather than regurgitating it i.e. be more of a listener than a talker. Take mental notes of ""lines"" people use to make the conversation go smoothly. With this and time, you will become a social warrior."

4312,CandidumFire,AskReddit,ENTP,"To this question, I have two answers.

The reason I have two answers is that there are two different kinds of Christianity that you have to denounce before becoming an atheist. 

REASON 1

The first kind of Christianity believes everything in the Bible happened LITERALLY. They think the flood actually happened, the Earth was created in a week, there was a land of milk and honey, and many other things. This type of Christianity also believes that God is literally a man that sits on a cloud and watches everything you do. Not only has the bible been disproven by history and science, but it has also shown god to be an evil person. Putting people in hell because they don't believe you exist? Sure why not. Wiping out firstborn children because their dads were misbehaving? Seems reasonable. There are many other examples, but these alone would have me turn against the Christian God just because of the sheer evilness.

REASON 2

The second kind of Christianity suggests that the Bible is a series of parables and should not be taken literally. Instead, it should be used to derive moral lessons. They also believe God to be ""first cause."" That is, he is the reason why anything exists. This kind of Christianity, to me, is more reasonable and harder to argue with. I agree that some great life lessons can be learned from the Bible; I also agree that scientists current explanation for where the universe came from is too similar to the concept of a free energy device. It breaks the law of thermodynamics. In the end, I still turn this form of Christianity down because I can take moral lessons from the Bible without being Christian as I can with any other religious texts, and God being ""first cause"" doesn't give me any reason to turn around and start worshipping him. It gives me no benefit to give an ounce of my energy to some Almighty creator who can't even talk to me because he is some abstract concept rather than a man on a cloud.

THE END RESULT

I am happier now that I'm an atheist and I'm also worse off now that I'm an atheist. I feel like I know the truth, in that no one really knows what's going on. When I look around I see people afraid of death because no one knows what that really means. I think religions spring up to help ease our existential burden. They give certain explanations so that you do not have to be afraid of dying or having a meaningless life. The value in religion is that it gives you security and the evilness of religion is that it gives you security. I struggle with extreme existential depression now that I've left my religion. But in the end it is made me a better person. I value people more, I value the people in my life more, I value my time more, and I'm overall a nicer and and kinder person. I have gained wisdom, character, and love in exchange for my happiness."

4315,IraelMrad,HPHogwartsMystery,ENFJ,"Wow that was so nice of them, I almost feel bad for all the times I criticized the game "
4316,IraelMrad,HPHogwartsMystery,ENFJ,"I'm so happy they're giving us an event with so many notebooks and a prize that's not so great. I mean, it's house pride, I feel like they should put the best outfits in crest events since we can win them if we want, and leave stuff like this to house pride given that almost nobody manages to get the first prize there "
4317,IraelMrad,HPHogwartsMystery,ENFJ,This is the content I play this game for
4318,IraelMrad,dragonage,ENFJ,"Wait, have you done Blackwall's companion quest in Inquisition?

4325,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,THE GATEWAY HAS OPENED! HIDE YOUR WALLET! welcome tho.
4326,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,"I have both and love both :]

Eco: more nib options (interchangeable), much better ink capacity (piston fill, requires ink bottle), demonstrator (it's clear so you can see how much ink you have left) and looks dope.

Metro: tends to write finer as they're Japanese nibs, very hefty and durable (made of brass), have more color options, can be filled with a converter (bottled ink) OR cartridge, it's a bit smaller, it's a snap cap (whereas the twsbi is a twist cap), and also looks dope.

That's just off the top of me head but in depth reviews can be found online. 

Good luck!"
4327,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,"Is your left tine busted or is it the photo? When I spring a nib I usually overlap then underlap (is that a word?) The two tines till they finally decide to meet in the middle (gently tho). Worked for my steel nibs, haven't tried on a gold. Live Falcon, liiiiiiive!"
4328,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,I would use a loupe to be sure the tines aren't too tight. That caused the stinginess in the flow of some of my pens. Open them up just a tiny bit and it should be Gucci. Wouldn't hurt to check the alignment of the tines either
4329,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,Oooh Benu. How's the nib on that pen? Looks so pretty omg.
4330,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,"Good choice, though you may inevitably get both at some point :p. Note if you like to change inks often the pilot may be a better fit cause of the smaller ink capacity."
4331,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,"i like to find pens that fit best for certain situations like best portability (vanishing point, to me), best ink capacity with no burping (opus 88, to me) finest nib point that i would like, italic/stubs, and etc. wishing you the best in your journey!"
4332,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,"I saw the Momento Zero and they're sexy af but as stated in the comments, weirdly overpriced for an eh steel nib (eh from what i've heard). if you wanna go for flashy i'd go for the leo if you want a gold (smoother?) nib go for the 3776. note that the 3776 doesn't come with a converter... from what i remember. if you post pics of the leo if you get that one that'd be cool of you too \*w\*"
4333,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,The biggest issue I had with flow issues with any pen is the mudda fuggin converter. Check to see if the ink FREELY FLOWS as you tilt it. If it just stays in place like it doesn't believe in gravity then that's your problemo.
4334,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,Oo yeeeez. If I get one I'm totally pairing it up with noodler's uv ink and writing in the dark lol
4335,Itsmebyroni,fountainpens,ENFP,"Right? I made just nib wasn't clogged with dry ink, tines are perfect and ink supply is fine... I hope to get another like this lol"
4336,Useless_lesbian,holdthemoan,INFP,Am I the only one who feels bad for the person that has to clean this up?
4337,Useless_lesbian,asoiaf,INFP,"I fucking hate that ""It's a fantasy story. Nothing has to make sense"" excuse so much. Yes, it absolutely does have to make sense. Just because there are dragons and giants in a story doesn't mean that we can have yogurt rule the world and see trees fly in the air. How do people still not get that?"
4338,Useless_lesbian,Overwatch,INFP,"Question; wouldn't it be easier for Blizzard to give a timer for when the event ends? It seems like that would save a lot of problem for a lot of people.

(i'm super thankful that the event is back tho. I almost missed out on the most important skin)"
4339,Useless_lesbian,europe,INFP,It's honestly disgusting to me how much sex trafficking takes place. And the fact that they only served 8 months in prison? Ridiculous.. 
4340,Useless_lesbian,Overwatch,INFP,But aren't you hyped to play Lucioball again for the 8th time? :P
4341,Useless_lesbian,Overwatch,INFP,"I shouldn't be surprised that she lied, cause we are talking about Sombra. But I still am. "
4342,Useless_lesbian,relationships,INFP,"Also the fact that if he stops calling her ""Dear"" and ""Sweetie"" it will sabotage their friendship. That alone just sounds very weird to me. That and that he stayed over at another girl's house without letting know his girlfriendü§î"
4343,Useless_lesbian,AskReddit,INFP,"I wouldn't worry about it at all. I am raised by my mom to always be prepared for anything. When she and my dad divorced she had no money for a house and the three of us; my mom, my brother and I had to sleep in a tiny room together at my aunts place for months. I am going to be living together with my boyfriend for 3 months in America over 6 months and I have a secret stash too. I love him and I am sure everything will be okay, but I am just being cautious, for if something goes wrong. "
4344,Useless_lesbian,sex,INFP,"Actually, with her trying to stop him and him not stopping, this is abuse AND rape. The moment someone doesn't give consent anymore and you keep having sex with them you are raping them."
4345,Useless_lesbian,lifeisstrange,INFP,"I feel like a second game with Max and Chloe would be boring. I love the first game and I like their story, but what would the second game even be about? Max and Chloe cooking and doing house chores? Them getting into silly time travel shenanigans? Their story is over. It would just be cheap imo to just write some nonsense about them. "
4346,Useless_lesbian,StrangerThings,INFP,They better do something nice for him next season :(
4347,Sol-is-bored,confessions,INFP,"Communication is the key! If she has more experience, see this as a bonus, and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask her what she likes even while doing it. Plus, guiding someone isn‚Äôt awkward, it can actually be really fun. Don‚Äôt be afraid, have fun when you feel ready and yeah, c o m m u n i c a t i o n"
4348,Sol-is-bored,cursedcomments,INFP,This made my vagina retract inwards
4349,Sol-is-bored,confessions,INFP,"As a gay woman myself I‚Äôd say just tell them ""hey man look, I know this is something that sometimes upsets gay people but trust me, I‚Äôm not assuming you‚Äôre attracted to me. I just wanna get the message across that we are, and will only ever be, friends. I‚Äôm saying that because I had past experience with gay friends who didn‚Äôt respect my boundaries. Just so we‚Äôre fixed.""

And if they don‚Äôt respect your boundaries after you‚Äôve said that, they‚Äôre just assholes and you can shoo them out of your life.

Even when listening to my older work was hard to do, because all I could hear were the flaws. But this tape gave me the courage to keep going. Countless hours spent writing and recording (hell, some times i'd even spend 20 minutes just to say 2 lines, so they would sound the way i wanted them too). This month long process eventually lead to the completion of this project. And for once, I can not only acknowledge my growth, but i can sit back and relax to my own music. I'm beyond happy that i can share this feeling with you all, especially on a subject matter that is so important to me. Not only do I hope that this tape can bring closure and good music for us all, but can do justice for the culture of hip hop. Props to all the LGBTQIA independent artist out there\~"

Ursus was no doubt scared, but the love you guys showed him throughout his life and especially in his last moments made him feel safe entering the unknown.

Never really resonated with horoscopes, but I did normally feel connected to the different personality descriptions. Bought a book in college that bascially went in-depth on the different personalities of each sun sign, and even my friends thought the book was scary accurate. But it wasn't until an old co-worker of mine made the whole office look up their natal charts that I really, truly believed in how planet placements made you who you are in this life, and how the movements of these planets affect us in a daily basis. That report read me for filth. LOL!!"
4384,teedub21,mbtirelationships,ENFP,"One thing I've learned from my interactions with my INTJ friend is that this type has no problems with brutal honesty, either on the giving or the receiving end.

4475,R-C-M,NoNonsenseMBTI,INFJ,"Intuition to me is a method of approaching information. It involves a hands off observational approach that analyzes the info, comparing and tying together bits of the info until it forms a big picture grasp of what is happening. It is very fast about building a framework to then expand upon or strengthen when given new information. 

Sensors in contrast are more likely to take little bits of information and slowly piece them together to form the whole theory, and so are not as quick at times to observe the big picture understanding, but are more methodical in approach.

I guess to make a metaphor for it, sensors prefer building up the house one brick at a time, starting from the ground and methodically working up. Intuitives ignore the bricks at first and build a scaffold or frame that outlines the house before filling it in as the bricks come, often in no particular order."
4476,R-C-M,ENFPAdulting,INFJ,"Lol, the extrovert thing cracks me up every time. ENFPs are probably more likely to identify with being a social ambivert or even introvert, Ne isn't really an interpersonal or social function in the same way Se is, so that stereotype is more likely to fit ESFPs if anything. 

I'm an INFJ, so I was actually curious about your experience with Ne dominant in relationships... Obviously it is unhealthy and immature behavior to only use one function for decision making, but it does make sense that Ne might be constantly on the lookout for new greater possibilities. Is this still a thought in your head that pops up from time to time or does Fi auxillary imbuing a strong personal value on the other outweigh it?"
4477,R-C-M,ENFPAdulting,INFJ,"Yay! This is awesome, I'm super thrilled to see someone making this happen, thanks! I would do something similar to help provide an alternative to the dumpster fire that is r/INFJ, but some friends have already convinced me to make a typology discord server which is enough on my plate in terms of internet moderation for me.

Looking forward to reading and hopefully contributing to some real typology discussions!

Hope you don't mind having an INFJ in the mix üôÇ"
4478,R-C-M,NoNonsenseMBTI,INFJ,"He has done a fair amount of good in bringing newer people more in depth into typology, but I think he oversimplifies some things and over complicates others. His function descriptions are pretty narrow in focus and while they generally aren't flat out wrong, they miss the majority of what the function actually does. For example, Si being about ""receiving experience"" is only one small aspect of Si that isn't even always true and depends on the particular user in how they have learned to use their functions based on nurture.

As for other aspects of him, his discord channel is a disaster. Many people are finding that the moderator team directly under CSJ are constantly banning people for daring to disagree with aspects of his theory as though his word is the end all be all of psychology. I was personally banned for simply being apart of a different server made with the intent of allowing free speech to talk about his theory or others without worry of being banned.

Upon speaking with many people coming from different perspectives and different theories, CSJ's theory in all honesty is beginning to look like a sloppy hodgepodge of random bits of tons of other theories (very little original work) while mostly failing to acknowledge what comes from what. I have no issues with him borrowing content from other theories, but do so honestly and give some friggin credit where credit is due! It also seems that some of his actual original work is imo over exaggerated and mostly impractical. When being told by some of his personal favorite expert typists that I can't possibly have any good childhood memories because I have Si demon, I can't help but think he has taken some parts too far.

That all being said, I will admit that it was CSJ that spiked my curiosity to start digging deep into Jungian typology and without him, I may not have continued on towards studying source material and learning a lot more about it."
4479,R-C-M,NoNonsenseMBTI,INFJ,"This is the main method I am trying to master right now, but I'm curious if you have any sources to go to for how a cognitive axis shows up practically. I've watched some of Michael Pierce's stuff, great descriptions, but it is a little theoretical for practical typing."
4480,R-C-M,NoNonsenseMBTI,INFJ,">I believe that anyone with a ""strong"" personality is more dysfunctional than someone who seemingly comes off as unable to be typed. Ultimately, we're aiming to ""lose"" our personalities.

Would you rather be a master of none but somewhat proficient at many things or be the best at one thing? I would prefer to specialize because there are plenty of people who can do a lot of things fairly well, but there is a very big need of those who are *really* good at one thing. I would definitely say I have a strong personality and I am proud of it, because it makes me unique. If everyone was the same bland personality, then there wouldn't be a need to work together as everyone would be capable of doing the same thing. Realizing what you are good at and focusing on that gives you the ability to do that one thing far better than anyone else possibly could, which then combined with finding those who can cover your blindsides means that we can progress far more effectively as a species as all sides are covered.

I would agree that if you find yourself described completely by the ID of your type, then that probably means you are underdeveloped, which is where socionics comes in. A mature person will be harder to type as they have integrated their subconscious and unconscious sides of the mind, but these are used to amplify and cover some of the blindsides of the ego. It is also important to develop these different sides as it gives you the ability to ""interface"" with other types that you wouldn't normally be very good at communicating with, giving us even more ability to work together and increase our efficiency of problem solving.

So I guess after all that rambling, to some extent I would agree in that we need to be well rounded, but we should also acknowledge our strengths and hone it to a razor edge. Being well rounded gives us the ability to work more efficiently with others who have a different specialty, but you will *never* be as good as someone of the opposite type at their specialty, so don't pretend like you can. Be good enough at what they do to be able to appreciate their strengths, but also be humble enough to realize they are better at it and refer to them for their specialty."
4481,R-C-M,NoNonsenseMBTI,INFJ,"I don't think the socionics take on compatible types is very accurate. ESTP and socionics' INFJ? seriously? They just tend to get on my nerves. I find we have very little in common and value very different things.

I would claim that a types shadow or unconscious is a better pairing than what socionics claims, so INFJ-ENFP seems to work out really well in my experience at least."

I would call it a perception of something you are very used to that you see as ""common"" or part of the ordinary. What are you more used to than your own routines and thought processes?

It always dumbfounds me when Americans thinks stating the population of a country somehow negates any possibility for systemic reform. Norway has about the same population as Colorado, would it be impossible to copy the system on the state level? Of course it would. But this population incompatibility line is just that ‚Äì a line.

There is of course also the fact that the US is obviously richer than Norway, but for some reason you lot seem to think that every member of society has to have a higher average income to somehow be worthy of rehabilitation of something.

It's not for a lack of possibility that that system couldn't work in the US, it's a lack of will.

What they show people is how good the afterlife is that we all know inherently but subdue because we fear death. They take away that fear and the evolved sense of survival we have to defend our life. 

As a corollary to this, I think it is an interesting possibility that it was some form rapture that did indeed quite visibly discriminate between good Christians and sinners and non-believers. Mallory's sister reacts with terror and deep sorrow to the angels, taking her life with remorse. John Malkovich's wife sees her departed mother and steps calmly into a burning car. Was the former made aware of her sins and made to take her life with regret, and the latter shown the ecstasy of paradise and reuniting with her loved ones as a believer? "

4597,AnonimArGer,armenia,INTP,"Depends who you ask although as a keen europhile myself I see Armenia more as a European country (and yes, I am aware that in terms of aesthetics Armenia has borrowed a lot from Middle Eastern region).  In my experience, American Armenians tend to see themselves as more Middle Eastern whereas Armenians from Armenia by and large consider themselves European ( I will try to find the source later on). 

The issue is that Transcaucasian region, which is where we are, is a weird one - it does not 'obviously' fir into either the Middle East or Europe. Again, my personal experience is that people in the rest of Europe tend to consider Armenia and to a lesser extent Georgia as non-European when they see those countries on the map but after going there or talking to Armenians/Georgians they change their minds. 

Someone mentioned genetic studies - here as well Armenians (just like many other borderline groups) show a great diversity - I guess many here can guess which study I will link [https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2015206](https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2015206). Plurality of Armenians have R1b haplogroup, although J2 and  haplogroup G  are also highly common. In terms of phenotype Armenians are also highly diverse - my mother is usually confused with North Eastern European, with my dad most people think he is a Jew from Israel while my brother is usually considered French (and we all come from Armenia). This is coming from just one family but there are many people who could easily be confused with Indians or Western Europeans."

I understand the desire to move Armenia to Europe but practically Europe (sadly) neither wants nor is able to do anything for Armenia. Meanwhile moving away from Russia can be really dangerous ...  What we need to do is stop looking for someone to protect us and establish strong military with advanced technologies. Given that we have a developing IT sector and a government that seems to want reforms this is very much possible."

Orwell covered this subject extensively in his book Homage To Catalonia, but there is a lot of additional material.

4666,Klouted,dating_advice,INTP,"I also have very limited dating experience but I am genetically bad at talking to girls.  

It starts with the approach.  Are you awkward?  Cause if so this part can be tough.  I practiced on some less attractive girls‚Äîjust a little ‚Äúsmall talk‚Äù (the hardest thing in the world for me; I‚Äôm a lone wolf philosopher/historian/scientist type who seldom discusses day-to-day concerns).  I had to read guides on how to do this.  Essentially my method is to find a light topic that‚Äôs relevant to the situation and somewhat humorous, get them smiling, smile back, and find a slightly clever way of asking for their phone number.

I‚Äôll usually call within 1-3 days (still not sure how this part works).  And I‚Äôll talk to them for a few days or weeks and usually get ghosted, or I‚Äôll lose interest.  Ghosting is rampant nowadays, and it‚Äôs a similar feeling to being dumped for no good reason.  Although I admit it is hard to tell someone that you don‚Äôt want to continue dating because of their hygienic issues, or smells, etc. a conversation is still the proper way to handle it.

Dating in the modern era is extremely challenging for me because I can‚Äôt read the feelings.  I can tell when they‚Äôre losing interest but I can‚Äôt fix it.  I think my problem is that I‚Äôm not showing enough emotion.  But that is how I am wired, very emotionless, and apparently I‚Äôm also wired to think most girls are boring after a few weeks.

Try to strike up a conversation and see if it leads to any sort of spark or feels like there could be a vibe or connection, then ask for their phone number.  From there, it really just depends on the situation I guess.  Try to read what‚Äôs going on and be as funny as possible.  Avoid heavy pet names and lovey dovey stuff until it‚Äôs time. Make all jokes that come to your mind.   If they don‚Äôt like your humor it wouldn‚Äôt work anyway.  Coming on too fast OR too slow can be an issue; depends on the girl and the situation.  Don‚Äôt be a real liar, but don‚Äôt be afraid to feed them a line of hilarious BS about your past, job etc.  these are great chances to make jokes while being mysterious.  Find out what works for you and practice that.

The best advice is to ‚Äújust be yourself,‚Äù even though it seems platitudinous (if not impossible) it is truly the correct aspiration.  The other best advice is to get out there and try, over and over, and be undeterred by rejection and failure, yet another impossibility but your goal nonetheless.  Be polite to them but not a pushover.  Get em laughing and make them feel comfortable with you, but not ‚Äútoo‚Äù comfortable.  Play your strengths: I found mine is ‚Äúmysterious.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt give real answers to their questions, which means they can‚Äôt build a real profile of me.  However after time this works against me because I am cold and do not really desire closeness, just company.  It‚Äôs a crazy world out there full of crazy people but there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúgood crazy‚Äù ones, much fun to be had, and a life to be lived to the fullest, and I wouldn‚Äôt take back any of these flings or failed relationships because they made me cooler.  Good luck!"
4667,avakee,changemyview,ENTP,"Ye but that‚Äôs because you understand the different personalities and are altering your answers, it‚Äôs not like if you were truly answering for yourself you‚Äôd get multiple different personalities"
4668,avakee,changemyview,ENTP,"Ok I totally see your points 
And I can recognize that there IS vagueness 
Yet there‚Äôs also very specific traits 
EG 
- ENTJs take on the role of managing in groups 
INTPs have trouble managing groups
- ENTPs like to debate 
INFJs do not like conflict 
These are polar opposites so if an ENTP was to read an INFJ description it wouldn‚Äôt fit them"
4669,avakee,changemyview,ENTP,"‚ÄúYour first three points make essentialy the same point. Any common like or dislike can form a bond, or a sense of belonging and identity. The question to ask is, is that sense meaningful when it comes to bonding over a common Myers-Briggs personality type? It's not obvious to me that it is so. Could you please elaborate?‚Äù

my original three points were just one broken down
Basically I was outlining 
A) you feel part of community (point 1)  
B) this community has people similar to you (point 3) 
C) being in this community give you a stronger understanding and self awareness (point 2) 
So, yes they are related but I wouldn‚Äôt say they are the same...

I think the sense of identity and community is actually really meaningful. 
The identity comes back to validating your strengths and weaknesses, making you feel like you aren‚Äôt alone in your weaknesses and that your strengths are meaningful.
Not only do these online communities often give really solid advice, but they give validation for deep insights and your opinions (In contrast to other social media forms, targeted at the same audience, which are often centered around your looks or your privileges (EG going on Holidays, going to fancy restraunts etc) )

‚Äú I don't get this at all. Please explain. If one needs to read up on personality types to empathize and communicate with others, pretty much the most basic of skills for living in society, then one has not been adequately socialized.‚Äù

Firstly, believe it or not, there are people out there who aren‚Äôt adequately socialized and maybe being able to understand for example; why they are quieter, why people jump from one idea to the next, why some people don‚Äôt reason well with logic etc.... might actually be helpful. 

That‚Äôs all I can type for now.. ifk maybe I skipped over some of your arguments but basically those were the ones that‚Äôs stood out to me"

Also if you keep on getting different answers I would recommend to get a friend to take it for  you as maybe your self awareness isn‚Äôt extremely high"

4680,adaptaBill,exchristian,INTJ,"Actually, I need to come back to this and vent. 

It is true that the lgbt+ community are at risk of mental illness and conditions, and it's not uncommon for someone in the community to suffer from mild to severe mental issues. 

But chicken before the egg here. Seriously. Being told you are born incorrectly from early childhood, being ridiculed by peers and parents and role models at impressionable ages, guilt-tripped into religious practices and being forced to conform to an idea that is unnatural to you, in very much the same way left handed people were forced to conform to writing with their 'proper' hand. Having insults, death threats, and discriminatory words and actions done against you weighs on your happiness. 

The risk of losing loved ones and family and jobs and financial security if you love or live with someone who brings you happiness is, in itself, a great cause of sadness and anxiety. 

In a compounding effect, rejection, trauma and the combination of social determinants all come together to make life fucking difficult for someone in the lgbt community, and that's in a country that doesn't stone them, kill them, or imprison them. 

Ergh. My blood boils.

4714,mayamii,sex,ENFP,"Lol first
If you stay with her for the sole reason because you are afraid to not find anyone else it is no reason why the sex doesnt  work  between you two.

You should  be aware that sex is part of communication. If you two connect on an emotional level  and communicate  in a healthy way usually the sex is good as well.  
How the sex life is is usually  an indicator for how well you communicate. 

Break up with her if you just stay with her for not being single. Thats hella respectless. And it sounds like you would  ditch her as soon as you find  someone else. Thats how cheating happens.  

Second: yes the pill can influence the libido. You can read up the side effects of the pill. They are pretty scary and i made experience with  that as well so i can confirm."

As you said it is hers to decide to post pictures of her body and if it makes her happy it isnt wrong. And she even tags you in the photos to show that you are her boyfriend.  
You should keep that in mind. 

But if it emotionally affects you, talk to her.but i would refrain on insisting that it is wrong for her to post the pictures. You  can only ask her to stop doing that for your emotional wellbeing and for the relationship with you. 

If it furthermore stays a conflict it would be good to reevaluate if you two and your morals are compatible and talk with  her  about it and if there is no compromising for the two of you it would be time to part."
4720,mayamii,relationships,ENFP,"You should really reconsider if you want to marry this man. If there is no trust  to begin with even if you offered all basis for it to be, what is the point.

After I started recording my games it's much more clear how I can ""carry"" by making less mistakes regardless of champ. And those mistakes are really small and still make a great impact.

Some of the winnable games I technically throw with one small mistake and then there are games you indeed have no influence on - people who throw/leave 'cause you lose point A or a couple of disorganized people not playing as a team at once. And then there are games you get carried even though you play terribly.

This all leads to ups and downs in your SR and eventually you come back to your initial rank again."

4748,n4m3Unknown,OverwatchUniversity,ISFP,"^ This advice. Likewise, some people in game are close to throwing (low elo btw) when they see someone on the team playing a hero that usually should get countered by something the other team is playing but the team might be actually losing because of someone's regular but badly played hero (or other things like not grouping up and people trickling in all the time).

I think knowing when swapping to a ""counter"" is no longer a thing is an experience thing. When you actually focus on a handful of heroes so well that you know swapping to a counter wouldn't solve anything as the hero would be played under your regular skill. But for someone who's getting regular practice in flexing many, many heroes, swapping actually will likely work (assuming there's no other issue with their general gameplay style)."
4749,n4m3Unknown,howtonotgiveafuck,ISFP,"I am going to pick on some things that might or might not be a part of the issue

* You rely _entirely_ on someone's else's opinion (and on top of it, one person only) instead of making your own (that's not a problem in itself if you might be blind to certain facts)

* You have a negative attitude: ""I'm not the greatest looking guy he ever met"" = you translate it into ""told me I look ugly"", not being the prettiest person doesn't have to do with being really ugly

* Has he objectively stated what's the problem? Everyone has good and bad parts (looks) and sometimes all it takes is to lift up the positives to hide/balance the negatives.

* Don't base your value (or whatever you want to call it) purely based off your looks. They matter more in certain fields (modeling, ...) and less in others (jobs to do with other skills and to real friends).

I believe you feel so down about being told this because you maybe based your whole identity around your looks? (I could be wrong though.) It's important to maintain development in many various life areas that grant you confidence in yourself so when you don't experience ""heights"" in one, you won't go the depressive route because you still get to appreciate yourself for many other things - think of them as having crutches to hold onto."
4750,n4m3Unknown,OverwatchUniversity,ISFP,I didn't know for a long time (lvl 500 ;-; ) that you can see your own team's ult statuses on the stats screen (when you tab).
4751,n4m3Unknown,OverwatchUniversity,ISFP,"The way I see Ana right now (with the dive heroes) is that the moment someone focuses you, you can't heal that effectively or might die even easier (vs. more than one) than other healers, because their escape kit is just so much better.

Secondly, people are no longer used to how to position with an Ana on your team properly (which makes it hard for you to stay in a safe spot). They just want a pocket Mercy. (*Sigh.*)

I'm an Ana main but I had to drop playing her for comp almost altogether 'cause I feel that even if I make almost no mistakes and try my best, the impact unlike other healers I have on fight is minimal. (I pick her nowadays only against a problematic Mei or a Hog tho for the anti-heal, makes them swap off quite fast.)"
4752,n4m3Unknown,OverwatchUniversity,ISFP,"Could be, I think it's often the flying Mercy (or other support) I try to bubble during those critical ults (which don't provide for being at a good angle sadly as lots of stuff is already happening)"
4753,n4m3Unknown,MakeNewFriendsHere,ISFP,"I'll add some things that might be hard to respond to (as a /F sometimes feeling overwhelmed with msgs):

* (legit happened a couple of times) ""I didn't read your whole post but I think we'd be great friends"" :D

* (optional) mentioning interests but not being specific (naturally you get responses from ppl who have same interests as you, and you may get many msgs that seem looking almost identical for this reason - meaning, who's gonna be the one getting a response? The one bringing up specific topics to attention. - But yeah it's not a rule, sometimes I just prefer answering to a brief msg because it doesn't let me overthink things, you kinda just let the things play out.)

* people who msg might not have mutual goal for friendship or the goal might be unclear (saying ""you're just bored"" when the post is asking for a close friend, time schedule/demands might not match, ...)

* (potentially negative) way too long msgs (think past half the page up to entire screen you view on your 24"" FHD monitor)

* **Also for what helps;** big one - giving a rough draft of what are you up to / going through in the life right now (both positive or negative) usually gives me a fine opportunity to relate or ""see"" the person behind the text

Also honestly I don't know about the deal with bad msgs, I feel like large majority of what I ever get on these subreddits are pretty fine responses (open, personal, friendly)."

4769,zxcpoi_,AmItheAsshole,INFJ,NTA. Do it for those of us who couldn't
4770,zxcpoi_,AmItheAsshole,INFJ,"YTA.

There seem to be several issues at play here that are frustrating you. 

1. Your parents perceived poor money management skills. 
2. They are not using your gift in the way that you approve (spending on floors vs vacation)
3. They don't seem to be as poor as you thought, ie., They are not suffering sufficiently and you feel your good intentions have been taken advantage of. 

My thoughts are:
1. This is a separate topic independent of your gift and should be addressed separately. There also seems to be some resentment from your teens about your parents not being professionally successful. 
2. Are you giving them a gift, no strings attached, or is money a means of controlling them? You value vacations, but maybe they value floors more because they have to see and use them everyday. Do you only offer them your support (via money, in this case) if they live in accordance how you think they should live?
3. This is a tricky area as it's hard for anyone to judge how much is ""enough"" for someone else -- do they have enough money/stuff, are they suffering enough to warrant assistance etc. I personally think it's a bit high handed to dictate to someone else what ""enough"" is.  

Given the limited picture we have of their finances, it does seem like a poor idea to leverage their residence for a non-neccessity while they are on a fixed income. If you are estranged from them, what good does that do anyone?

In the future, if you want to attach strings to your gift, maybe you can offer to pay for their plane tickets or something like that, rather than giving cash. 

I'm also curious to know how they supported you in your struggles with substance abuse. Was it conditional or unconditional? Was it ""we're not going to give OP money because he's going to spend it on [substance], and we don't approve of that""?"

4777,zxcpoi_,AmItheAsshole,INFJ,"YTA, no question. 

Her ""transgression""?? Against what? Against you personally? Against your boss? Against some abstract Company Policy??

You reported her for not ""getting approval"" and then helped the company minimize ""possible liability issues."" Your top concern is, ""Is XYZ 'allowed'?"" Your head is so far up the corporate rulebook you've lost the ability to think and act like a normal human being. 

Many 9-yos are mature and well-behaved. Whose interest were you acting in? Maybe you thought by being a dutiful stasi you could earn your boss' trust and favor. Or maybe you're just the type that follows rules without thinking. You shirk the responsibility of your own morality when you hide behind Company Policy and behind your ""unintentional"" action. 

In real life, YTA for making this woman's hard situation even harder. But sleep easy knowing that you are an A+ stoodge for whatever master it is you unquestioningly serve."

Returning to the main thing ..

4826,Hanzou13,Dr_Harper,INFP,"Hey ! 

I think the fairest to everyone would be to separate the online, free translation, and the published, commercial one, as someone mentioned the fact that it's unfair for the professionals translators.

So we could do some kind of cooperative translation for reddit (using a software like the one the teams of subtitlers use), and put it under a Creative Commons license (that forbids commercial use, if I'm not wrong).  

This way it stays a volunteer work, with no money involved for the translators nor for you (you wouldn't be allowed to sell books out of this translation.) 

  
But when you want to do it for a commercial use, to publish the books in other languages (and that'd be great for you!!), you can hire a professional translator, he/she will do a new translation that can be commercialized.   


I think it's a fair compromise for everyone - for the professionals, for us, and for you :)"

Plus the addiction isnt only physical,  it's also the gesture, the body sensations, the social context, etc. So it makes sense that you ""miss"" this feeling - although it's probably your brain tricking you.
There are some plants that can be smoked, totally nicotine free (and not drugs ;) ). Like one mix is called green mango. 
Maybe you can try roll it and smokebit and see how this feels. 
For me, it really felt like shit, only gave me a sore throat and a ciggie craving. 
But it can help you to figure out that you don't really miss this feeling deep down.

'Coming out' shouldn't be an obligation either. Your obligation is, first and foremost, with yourself and your well being.

It seems to me you are already 'out' with who it matters the most. making it 'public' to the people you care about, or even the whole world will come along if you see fit, when you see it's best for you.

Sorry that I have to play the 'you are still young' card. But you are, and coming from this background, your concerns are valid and understandable.
Give it time.

You are having a good approach at this moment, as far as I can see, that is allowing yourself to think about this stuff and being right and truth with your feelings.

Let the 'coming out' part to your future self as you somehow work around it at your own time.

Give it time and it will become clearer as long as you keep being right with yourself.

Don't let anyone tell you different. If, because of this environment, you come across with lots of negativity, you will have to learn to make yourself strong and, if you can, take distance, even if it's just mental distance (if physical diatance is not an option) from it.

You have to know that you are not alone. Behind you is something bigger, much bigger than ourselves. 
We have to look at the past conquests from great people that made where we are today a reality. Conquests that cost some sweat, tears, blood, and even lives.

Their fight is our fight.
And you, being truth to yourself, is enough to honor it.

Let the coming out part come along, at your time, if you choose that path.
I wish you a very happy life."

I had a really rich, daughter-of-an-oil-tycoon-rich roommate at university, and when I'd casually mention the cost of something she'd look thrown off or surprised. She never bought things in advance to offset the cost like train or flight tickets, she'd literally show up and buy it on the day. Her family used to do their weekly grocery shop in fucking Harrods. Lol. I remember her buying some bresaola beef and casually mentioning she picked it up at Harrods. Blew my mind. She was super generous too, don't know if they're all like that, but a lot of flashy people are stingy when it comes down to it- the big spending only applies to themselves.

Okay so this is My POV: I work too, come home tired too. But when I get home I clean and cook - which also tires me out, when I'm already tired and would rather be in a bubble bath or binging Netflix. So when I am doing all of these things and see that my husband has been sitting on the couch, I get a little peeved because it doesnt seem fair.


To be honest, it really even irritates me that I have to ask all the time (i.e.""nag""). It doesnt seem  very loving to watch someone you care about exhaust themselves while your feet are up. 

So I get annoyed and ask him to do something or remind him of what needs to be done that he can help with. IF he ignores/dismisses me, I go full on nag mode with irritation on the side. 


TL:DR  - The intention is not to complain, it is to beg desperately for some support and help with the overwhelming amount of tasks that need to be done in the house. Tbh, on my end could likely be communicated better than only nagging."

It's important that you understand that if ignore it and pretend nothing happened, and he did try to be skeevy, he will learn that it's okay to cross boundaries. You can say it light hearted too. ""Hey I know you were sleeping and you probably didnt notice, but your hand kinda was touching my butt and it made me uncomfortable.""
His reaction will say alot about his intention, and at the very least you will send him the signal that you noticed, you are not okay with it, and you will not be quiet about it. 
I'm really hoping he gets embarrassed and apologizes and doesnt make you feel that way again, that would be a good sign."

Granted a lot of that time was used figuring out the systems, but still, soul searching is hard and seeing your motivations clearly is harder. What really helped me was time, sitting with the definitions floating in my head while observing how I really am in the day to day. 

Here's something I found useful. In the Enneagram there are three centers of intelligence: Thinking, Feeling, and Doing. Fours and Fives both repress the Doing center but in their own way. Fours feel. Then they have thoughts about their feelings. Then they have feelings about their thoughts about their feelings. And so on and so on and they never get around to doing anything. Fives think. Then they have feelings about their thoughts. Then they have thoughts about the feelings about their thoughts. And so on and so on and they never get around to doing anything. So what resinates with you more? Do you have thoughts about how you feel (Four) or do you have emotions about your thoughts and theories (Five)?

Hope that helps. Good luck to you."
5013,Bindlestyph,dndnext,INFP,"(Human variant with Magic Initiate: Wizard: Find Familiar, Prestidigitation, and another utility cantrip that doesn‚Äôt require a good Int. Maybe dancing lights or light to get around not having dark vision. Sage background.)

All his life he trained to be a wizard. Perhaps it was a family obligation. Though he diligently applied himself to his studies, arcane magic came very slow to him, and every lesson was an effort. Often he‚Äôd catch himself starring out the window, day dreaming about a bigger, more beautiful world. A place that was more alive than the dead books he had to read and the ridged theories he had to understand. To get a leg up on his classes he would spend long hours in the library, pouring over old tomes, and it was there that he first started learning about the druids. There were only hints at first. Odd references in texts about feral magic users in dark forests who were neither disciples of the arcane nor of a powerful deity. What little lore he could find was in a strange language, so to learn more he taught himself to read druidic. Soon he fell in love with the druids paradoxical philosophy.  Both live and let live, and kill or be killed. He began skipping classes, learning the ways of nature through experimentation in the forests near the school. This nature magic came easy to him, and soon he found himself wielding powerful magics. Finally one day, when the ridged reasoning of wizards was just too much to take for another moment he walked away, leaving his possessions and his former life behind. He is now wandering the wilderness. Perhaps he is transfixed by the wanderlust that was stifled for so long. Maybe he is in search of a real life druid to teach him more. Or maybe he is letting nature be his only teacher, following the ways of the druids all on his own. 

Mechanically, find familiar and being a druid lets you cure wounds etc from a distance, as well as scout and use for cool role play stuff. You Could wild shape and communicate with the familiar I believe. In fact you might get away with using Raven‚Äôs mimicry to talk to some extent through your familiar while you‚Äôre wild shaped. Fun stuff. Good luck."
5014,Bindlestyph,Anglicanism,INFP,"I grew up in the Eastern Orthodox Church where fasting is a very common practice. I added it up once, and taking into account Lent, and Advent, and all the special fast days, and the weekly fasts on Wednesdays and Fridays an observing Orthodox Christian is fasting for about half of the year. Also, unlike in the Catholic Church (at least as I understand it, I am not Catholic so can speak with very little authority about their practices) normal Orthodox Christians in the United States really do observe the fast as part of their day to day life. This may be because many of the Orthodox Christians in the United States are converts, leaving more liberal churches in search of a more conservative theological tradition.

Anyway, In this tradition fasting means removing specific things from the diet and the more strict you want to be and more things you remove. The least strict fast is abstaining from meat. Next one would give up dairy. Then fish. Then wine and oil. Finally the most strict fast would be abstaining from all food and only drinking water. This water only fast happens very rarely for non-monastics. Basically only in preparation for the Eucharist and maybe on Holy Saturday. Mostly we fast from meat, dairy, fish, wine, and oil. This is the kind of fast that is practiced every Wednesday and Friday, for the 40+ days of lent and holy week, for the 40 or so days of advent, and for numerous other times throughout the year. There are also practices of skipping meals. Perhaps only eating a single meal at night.

That's the ""What we do"" of fasting, but not the ""Why."" Fasting really isn't about food. It is about quieting your life so that you can pay attention to God. Another way to put it is, we eat less so we can pray more. Especially with preparation for the Eucharist and during Lent, fasting also means a sort of minimalism. It means turning the radio off in the car and turning the TV off at home. It often means abstaining from sex. It means quieting your environment from needless noise and activity and looking for stillness.

One thing to note: Fasting Orthodox Christians don't refrain from eating and doing these things because they are bad. You don't fast from meat because meat is bad. A married couple during Lent does not abstain from sex because sex is bad. You don't drive to work in silence because music is bad. These things are all good. But when we fast they are often needless complications that get in the way of quieting your life to better hear/know God.

One other thing, I have heard many a priest speak words of caution about mixing up dieting and fasting. It confuses the point of what you are doing and why. Fasting is sort of the bodily version of praying, and no I can't explain that any better. You can also make fasting into a false idol. If Lent is only about getting rid of certain things, and look how much of a good christian you are, then you're better off eating a big mac and starting over.

That is a very short overview of the Orthodox Tradition of Fating. If you are really interested in this I would recommend getting more information. The best thing you could do would be to go find an Orthodox Priest and ask you questions. Here in the USA there is usually a church pretty close. Greek, Russian, OCA, Antiochian, doesn't really matter. You don't have to be Orthodox to ask questions. Another option (Though really, go talk to a priest or two) is podcasts and internet videos. Anything by Father Thomas Hopko is Awesome (RIP). In fact here is a vid/podcast by Hopko: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgWh8C7ezNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgWh8C7ezNE).

Hope that helps. Good luck to you.

&#x200B;

Edit: forgot some stuff

I am heavily into keto, intermittent fasting, and more recently the carnivore diet. I am not currently a practicing Orthodox as I have been flirting with skepticism for many years, but I still love many of the practices of the church. Anyway, my current views on nutrition and health at this point are so different from before that now, if I were to return to the church, I would not be able to, in good conscious, follow the fast as it is prescribed. Meat I think is necessary for humans, and replacing it with lentils and rice, at least today, in our food soaked modern lives, is not in my view a healthy or life giving change. If I start fasting again I will likely just fast completely from food, have only one meal a day, and/or eat only fish. 

I wanted to add this because I said rather flippantly said that fasting and dieting is ill advised. I do think this is true, but there is a difference between dieting out of vanity and taking up a Way of Eating that can save your life. If fasting is about ANYTHING it is about how the physical influences the spiritual. If you are fasting from food to get rid of obesity or diabetes, to treat cancer or epilepsy, or anything like that, and you are looking for a prayer practice to support you along the way, that sounds like an excellent idea. 

Second, in the Orthodox Church (as with Dr Fung) fasting is followed by feasting. Feasting is just as important as fasting, just as Doing a thing is as important as Preparation. For example, the 40+ days of lent in the Orthodox Church is followed by Pascha (easter sunday) where we have a giant feast. The week after Pascha, fasting is forbidden. In fact the 40 or so days after Pascha is generally considered a time of Feasting. Just wanted to make that point. There is no fasting without Feasting, and vice versa. Cheers."

5016,Bindlestyph,Enneagram,INFP,"Five wing Four here. I did a short stint with a therapist and looking back I wish I had been less strategic. I approached the therapy sessions thinking that the therapist was the expert in her field and that I should let her direct the sessions.  Like I was a broken computer and I wanted her to see how I was broken without my input biasing her one way or another. I think that was wrong headed.  I'd let her ask questions and I would answer them logically and to the best of my ability, but I could still always hide there. I could hide in what was NOT asked. I could hide behind logical answers. In the end I didn't get a lot out of it. If I were to do it again I'd try to be radically honest about how I felt rather than exhaustively rational about what I thought. I'd try to focus on what is true for me and my experience, rather than on what is true in objective reality.

Hope that helps, and good luck."

Your opinions and values are the ones with backing- there are still rules about what to say and do, but people are refusing to learn them. This is because the same systems of oppression that keep non-dominant groups from having equal opportunity are working to keep the dominant groups from seeing the need to change. Hyper-individualistic, non-structural understandings of racism and oppression are a direct result of systemic racism. Individual people who advocate for minorities are not in any way marginalizing those minorities (at least, not most of the time; there can definitely be individuals who do so poorly but I believe this would be very uncommon).

When we as social workers fight oppression, we are not saying ""you are incapable of success"" but instead that there are barriers in place that the dominant groups simply do not have. It's a sociological fact, but one that directly contradicts the common worldview in which individuals are responsible for themselves and that no other factors matter except in extreme cases, and sadly research has shown that such worldviews are extremely resistant to change.

You're doing good work. Your opinions and values (while certainly not perfect and likely to change slightly over time, because that's what happens to everyone) matter and have an impact."

5096,keilabl,NoNonsenseMBTI,ISTP,"http://www.practicaltyping.com/

The function overviews are more general but the function analysis articles and typing dilemma articles give examples.

Like... For instance, there's this one: http://www.practicaltyping.com/2018/09/10/11-differences-between-te-and-ti-users/"
5097,keilabl,NoNonsenseMBTI,ISTP,"I personally find the dichotomies limited.. The functions are more accurate. I'm saying that cause as a sensor, I'm not at all into details like sensors supposed should be. The details is Si users or the SJs specifically. Routine is also Si. And I need to understand why I'm doing something before I do it, but that's my Ni. Knowing alot of random information is Ne/Si while jumping to conclusions is Ni. Being skeptical is frequently a T thing not an intuition thing.. Alot of things are attributed to intuition that should not be, which is why everyone wants to be an intuitive and sensors are viewed as dumb. What two types are you struggling between?"
5098,keilabl,NoNonsenseMBTI,ISTP,">Why not? I have issues with almost any SJ I met and with 100% of ESTJs I met. I insult because I just wanted to do it. What's the problem? ESTJs feel free to do it whenever they want too. And they do it almost all the time. They're conflictive and aggressive.

Quite frankly, this sounds like a personal problem. I have worked and interacted with all 16 types, and I can usually get along on a basic level with just about everyone. Do I always like them? No. Do I hate them? No. I have a good relationship with my INFP sister (who is supposed to be the type in most conflict with me), my ENFP brother, my ISTP mother, and my ENTP father. I have good relationship with my in-laws (INFJ, ISFJ, INTJ, ISFP). I'm happily married to an ISTJ, who was my best friend for ten years prior to marriage. I have worked with ESFPs, ENFJs, INTPs, INTJs, and etc, plus several SJ types, including an ISTJs, ESFJs, and ESTJs. Did they irritate me at times? Sure. Did I hate them? Once again, no. I respected their ability to do their jobs well. We clashed at times, sure, and I know I irritated them on several occasions, but that's life. I still respected their ability to do their job, and saw their value in the workplace. Honestly, the type the I've probably legit fought with the most would be my ENTP boss. I didn't like him, and he didn't like me, and we both knew it, but that wasn't a matter of his MBTI type. If you're failing to get along with every SJ type that you come across, then I recommend you seriously start putting some work into your character."

5102,keilabl,NoNonsenseMBTI,ISTP,"Ah ok, well, a lot of the information out there tends to be vague, skewed, or stereotype ridden so it makes sense that people struggle so much. I personally like this site: https://practicaltyping.com/

It avoids stereotypes and tries to stay down to  earth. Here is an example of a function comparison article: https://practicaltyping.com/2019/03/12/5-main-differences-between-si-and-ni/

They go over alot of typing dilemmas so if you were between two types I would have sent you to one of those.

Oh and there's this: https://practicaltyping.com/2018/10/05/am-i-an-intuitive-or-a-sensor/"
5103,keilabl,insomnia,ISTP,"Well...I'm not sure how bad your insomnia is.. But for me, at one point as a teenager it just kinda clicked in my head that I'd survived with it up until then. Even though I'd go somewhere and lay awake nearly all night, I could always function the next day. It put things in perspective for me and I just stopped worrying about it. If I slept, I slept. If I didnt, I didnt. I'd managed so far so there was no real reason to stress about it and I didn't want it to get in the way of experiencing life. "
5104,keilabl,MbtiTypeMe,ISTP,"Tons of ideas constantly and weird questions all point to Ne. Manipulating people sounds tertiary Fe, and the anti-authority sounds stereotypical high Ti. Wanting people to like you even if you don't like them also hints at Fe.  Loving being the center of attention and bossing people around sounds extroverted, and you generally give the impression of dom Ne anyway, in addition with being easily bored  and an ""adventurer"" - typical dominant extroverted perceiver. The general anti-people tendency is frequently a T thing. Loving debate is stereotypical ENTP.

    How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

    Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?

    Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

    What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

    If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

    What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?

    How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

    Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

    Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

    Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

    What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

    How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

    Do you need logical consistency in your life?

    How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

    Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

    What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

    What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

    How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

    What's important to you and why?

    What are your aspirations?

    What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

    What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

    What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

    How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

    Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

    How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

    How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

    Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

    Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?

    What is the ideal life, in your opinion?
