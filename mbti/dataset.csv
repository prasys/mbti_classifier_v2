0,ENFJ,"Aight, let's help you my friend.

1/ Do you always want to know other people's stories, even not so close acquaintance? As in what they have been through, the hardships in their lives, etc...

2/ Do you feel this urge to help others whenever you can? (even if you don't help them, just having the urge is enough). Do you feel guilty if you turn the blind eye to someone in need?

3/ Are offensive jokes to people other than yourself an okay thing?"
1,ENFJ,"Just based off this, I’d say ISFJ, but it’s up for debate."
2,ENFJ,What do you relate to about ENFJ? All three types can have decently high Se which could explain the love of sports (plus sports are just good for you lol).
3,ENFJ,"I think you seem more ENTJ. You’re a very nice ENTJ but you don’t seem to have the drive of an ENFJ. The most obvious is the way you answered #1. Every ENFJ I know just loves people and learning about them, for no particular reason. It just feeds Fe/Ni."
4,ENFJ,"This is definitely the Ni in ENFJ. It could be Fe, but it could also be Te. Not all ENFJ’s bend over backwards to help other people—I draw boundaries, but I also do more than most people would bother with. If you’re looking at your entire life, do you tend to be a people pleaser? Do you tend to dislike and minimize unnecessary conflict? Do you mask your true emotions for the sake of others? How do you typically react to criticism, constructive or otherwise?"
5,INTP,I'm to introverted to talk to people.... Also I just hate people
6,INFP,"Carson memes are entering other subs, what is going on"
7,INFJ,"I don’t talk about this, like at all, with my friends, because I know they won’t give a shit."
8,ENTP,"I do this, only to find a fellow entp someday."
9,INTP,"I got a guy I'm talking to into MBTI and he started typing people within a week. And whenever I say/do anything, he goes ""ooh is that cuz you're an INTP? :/""

What have I done?"
10,INFP,"Sorry, but I don't watch anime"
11,INTJ,"That would require talking to others, which is an egregious breach of INTJ form, as you well know. Also they might be our type, which is awful, so it's best to stay silent and moan about no one understanding us. Just the way we like it. /s

But in all seriousness no. I'm socially awkward, not socially retarded."
12,INTP,Possible misanthrope?
13,INTP,smp live will take over
14,INTJ,Wtf is Carson? That's Joe.
15,INFJ,"Casually mention it as ""some silly, strange thing you saw on the Interwebs"" that they should ""try out to see what dictator they're like."" Trick them into taking it. >:)

Oh yeah, and mention that you're Hitler and Osama. They'll love it."
16,ENTP,Hello
17,ENTP,Hello
18,ENTP,Hi there
19,ENTP,"GET OUTTA HERE EDGELORD

jk lol, hi."
20,INTP,You've created a demon
21,INTJ,"We regret it too, bruh."
22,ENTP,Sounds xNTx-esque
23,INFP,How do you feel about cryptocurrency?
24,INFP,Oopsies you’re correct
25,INFJ,I’m Hitler and Jesus Christ at the same time
26,ENTP,Speak of the devil!
27,ENTP,Magic!
28,ENTP,Someone gets it
29,ENTP,Howdy partner
30,INTP,if i dont get a schlattcoin this year I'm going to die in the cuck shed
31,INFP,Whoa whoa what
32,ENTP,Hmm. What site are you using? Most of them are inaccurate.
33,INFP,The value only goes up
34,INFJ,"IKR? I have the ability to cause the holocaust and then undo it and do it again, which pretty fucked up and I’m not going to do that, but its there."
35,ENTP,"http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm is probably the best free one (site looks ugly though). It will give you raw results, as in it will tell you the percentages for all of your functions, not just the dichotomies (E/I, S/N T/F, J/P). Might be more helpful in understanding yourself. 

What I do is take the test like every couple of months. While I try to research in the meantime, I use the results from the test as like a basis for my calculations and ""pattern seeking"" - I'm hard to type as well. I actually don't have a type. It's possible to be true typeless and just choose what you want (or need) to be, for whatever situation, but only if you have very well developed ""cognitve empathy"". Most people rely solely on their ""affective empathy"" and so don't practice developing their cognitive empathy, therefore they aren't capable of doing that ""type switching"". Actors do a lot of this when assuming roles, or ""method acting"". It's just an aquired skill.

It's chaotic, but at least I'm not bored. The world seems quite beautiful from all the different angles too."

37,INFP,Do the Riso-Hudson Enneagram test with Myers-Briggs predictions
38,INFJ,They're actually the host
39,ENTP,"I wasn't invited though :(

\*gatecrashes\*

\*zipwires/rappels into argument\*

HERE I AM, FUCKERS!"
40,ENFP,"Let’s see how many ENTPs are gonna respond with, “Don’t tell me what to do!”"
41,INTJ,"Haaha you're right! But I don't think they shy away from responding to arguments, though."
42,ISFP,Thank you! Recently found out that I am an ISFP and suddenly so much of my past behavior makes sense now. The MBTI framework has been very helpful!
43,ISFP,It's a lifelong thing. Just found out about the MBTI. At least through the Myers-Briggs we know we're not alone!
44,INFP,Lol thanks I’ve got stuff to do. So many coincidences today and you just added to them
45,ENTP,"Thank you ❤ Just realized I was meaning to go to the bathroom, like 30 minutes ago"
46,INFP,I got an exam tomorrow thanks
47,INFP,"Honestly, ""go to bed, even"" is an important part of it. If possible, it's best not to stay up late doing something you can finish the next morning instead."
48,INFP,*ugh.. \*closes laptop\**
49,INTP,But I don’t want to do my homework
50,ESFP,"Bless you for this, I needed someone to kick me off... 

Also I like your avocado plant 😊"
51,ISFJ,Not an Ne user but wasted my time on reddit and the water currently running in the shower
52,INTP,"Thanks. 

This should be a daily or weekly post tbh."
53,ENTP,Don't tell me what to do!
54,ENFP,I'm in the shower while reading this... What should I be doing?!
55,INTP,"[reads post]

Thanks.

[goes back to scrolling]"
56,ENTP,I try to tell myself this all the time.
57,ENFP,"Never have i been so offended by something i 100% agree with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(No >:( )"
58,ENFP,"Fuck off, I know damn well what I’m doing...

*please help I can’t stop oh god I’m sleep deprived...*"
59,ENTP,Sitting here in my Calc III lecture on reddit...
60,INTP,"Thanks a ton. If you hasn't warned me, I would have learned about different species of cats found in major US cities, which would have brought in 0 value to my life."
61,INFP,"I appreciate your message, but I’m just gonna keep scrolling.

After upvoting for the avocado plant, that is."
62,ENFP,lemme waste my time in peace 😤
63,ESFJ,"Ups, I wanted to be in bed by now..."
64,INTP,Fuck I just got called out.
65,ENTP,I’ve got an essay outline and 3 body paragraphs due tomorrow and I haven’t even started thinking about it yet so thanks 😂
66,INFP,"tbh i needed this, i have to get up early for school tomorrow and need sleep to function. thanks"
67,INTJ,"ENFP's really are lil angels, huh? Also, how old is the avocado plant? How tall? Did you buy it pre-sprouted or did you do the sprouting it in water thing? I've been trying to grow one myself, but all three tries resulted in the avocado rotting before sprouting at they top enough to plant in soil. I did the toothpick thing and everything. Any advice?"
68,ENFP,This is just 👌
69,ENFP,"Damn you. Reddit is much more fun than work

Cute avo though"
70,INTP,Looking at you XXXXs
71,ENFP,"Why you calling me out?
Fine, I guess I’ll sleep now."
72,INFP,*closes app and starts recording again*
73,INFP,":)   
also good thing I mostly scroll reddit when im in the bathroom lol"
74,ENTP,Oop
75,ENFP,I feel attacked.
76,INFP,"I bullshitted a college writing assignment last minute yesterday. Oof, the constant pain as I was continually still acting to put it off."
77,ENFP,thank u fellow enfp i always forget that time exists
78,INFP,Bold of you to assume I'm able to sleep at night. Because I can't.
79,ENFP,Oh yeah I was supposed to go hang with my INTP friend 😂
80,ENTP,"But I don't want to sleep, sleep is for, like, actual people"
81,ENTP,"Jokes on you bitch! I'm already in bed, and what I wanted to do was lie down.

*maniacal laughter*"
82,INFP,:( Weeeh... just because my final is this Friday doesn't mean I need to stop. That is a very nice avocado plant. Are they tough to keep/raise?
83,INTP,I am angry that I see it now when waiting for a bus and not when I actually need it
84,ENTP,Lol.  I've been called out.
85,INTP,"Hahaha... Thanks. Really, honestly, thank you very much."
86,ENFP,"But... all those things that will make me feel bad, I just have to find more and then cry myself to sleep a few hours later than I should, I really can't skip that part of my routine"
87,ISTJ,Not a Ne users but thanks anyway.
88,ENFP,"You just helped me get home a half hour earlier than usual, thanks!"
89,INTP,"HEY. I didn’t ask to be called out like this. 


But yeah, you’re probably right."
90,ENFP,Rood!
91,ESFP,"i'm not even an intuitive but, thanks for reminding me to work on my paper, my guy."
92,INFP,Many thanks stranger
93,ISFJ,I needed this too. Call it a symptom of the times.
94,ENFP,Immediately Google's what does an avocado plant look like
95,ENFP,Lolol
96,ENTJ,"Strangely, I read that."
97,INTJ,Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
98,ENFP,I feel attacked.
99,ISTJ,Thanks I needed that
100,INFP,"I only ever scroll Reddit mindlessly.

Should I just bail and never look back?"
101,INTP,Hmm just woke up my... Should I go to bed again?
102,INTP,Am literally at work
103,INTP,This gave me notification so this post played itself.
104,ENFP,Can the internet stop calling me out please?
105,ENTP,I saw this meme three times today already :(
106,INTJ,*laughs in INTJ* peasants
107,ENTJ,Fuck you nobody tells me what to do
108,ENFP,"Glad to help! In a way, I also can remind myself with it :)"
109,ENFP,Anytime. Hope you're clean now!
110,ENFP,Oh my! Well best of Luck buddy!
111,INFP,"Omg FINE, goodnight. Ugh."
112,ENFP,*is proud of u*
113,ENFP,Neither do I want to go to work at 5 am tomorrow but hey - sometimes we can't choose our battles. But it feels good to tackle them and feel genuine freedom. 😋
114,ENFP,Happy cake day! - also second reminder. I'm watching you.
115,ENFP,Thank you! Her name's Ingrid
116,INTJ,Did you put off sleep and forget? I've done that before. The sudden realization the sun was up was quite unpleasant.
117,ENFP,Thank you!
118,ENFP,Save water! And tell me what phone you are using and if the audio and speakers are good in the bathroom??
119,ENFP,"please, pizza delivery has not been taken over by robots yet so we need our delivery people to be in good shape."
120,INFJ,I had the same thought.
121,ENFP,Thank you!!!
122,ENFP,Okay but water your plants atleast
123,ENFP,Wow I'm flattered!
124,ENFP,Thank you !!
125,ENFP,I guess I will just have to pop it in more frequently!
126,INFP,"*Grins sadistically in unhealthy INFP*

Your parents fight often, don’t they?"
127,ENFP,“and feel genuine freedom” yes this is what i gotta keep reminding myself
128,INTP,I'm intrigued. Is your avocado plant's name really Ingrid?
129,ENFP,Samsung Galaxy S9 and I haven't killed it yet
130,ENFP,"Ok, following this because same!"
131,ENFP,"That’s why we pay them minimum wage or less in most cases (I’ve been paid as little as $5.50/hr because the shop was in a ‘busy college town’), have them use their own vehicles, expect them to answer phones, clean, do kitchen work, and stay far past closing despite already crazy hours, all for the promise of tips that aren’t standardized or mandatory. No way to live, sometimes enough to survive when you’re in a tough spot (assuming you have credit or are otherwise incredibly financially responsible, something deliver drivers are known for lol). The robots are nigh.

I’m lucky I’ve been out of the game for years. Now I work in the mental health field, where the REAL money and respect are paid...at least we probably won’t be replaced by robots soon."
132,ENFP,Yes. The name came intuitively when I looked at her
133,INTJ,Reddit is hell for insomnia. I fully understand. You have my condolences.
134,ENFP,"This is so screwed up.... especially when people demand their delivery in less than 30 minutes. I am currently employed in the food industry as well (hopefully out of it too, soon). There are quite a few people who scare me with how oblivious they are to their privilege or lack of gratitude. Especially speaking to someone who has family in the 3rd world.... but hey, everyone shall get what they deserve. Keep going, social workers will always be needed and it's a little comforting to read that you're treated respectively in it."
135,ENFP,"“it's a little comforting to read that you're treated respectively in it.”

Oof. I hate to break it to ya...I was being quite sarcastic lol. Respect is shown by some of the people I know who think I’m “doing a good thing”, but, not really by my employers or clients. The pay sucks. This is the job I got after putting myself through school with a pizza delivery job lol.

And yeah, people can be very unsympathetic when ordering food. If the kitchen messes up and food get’s sent out late, guess who get’s blamed by the customer? The driver. Doesn’t matter if I ran every stop sign or red light to get it to them. To some people, late is late and I should ‘understand’ when they don’t tip. They seem to think tipping is a reflection on the business, not how I get compensated for for shit pay and using my own car and gas. Thank god for the nice people who ordered regularly and tipped well. They kept my bills paid."
136,INFP,"NFPs and INTJs are the most self aware I’ve seen, and ISXJs, ESFJs the ESFPs the least. Might be wrong just from what I’ve seen."
137,INTP,"i think xxfp would have a good sense of identity because of fi, and xstj the least. for being ""connected to reality"" i think its the opposite, especially xnfps are dreamy and idealistic while xstjs are more practical and grounded. so depends if you mean ""self-aware"" as in their own feelings or the outside world"
138,INTP," Most self aware would probably be NTPs, they have a good sense of identity without self worship."
139,ENTP,Sure as hell not ENTPs
140,ISFJ,ISxPs; ENxJs
141,ENFP,Sensors are almost always not very good at self-awareness. ENFPs like myself can rapidly fly between extremes...cuz we're crazy
142,ENFJ,ENFP
143,INFP,I’m an INFP and agree with you lol
144,ENFP,"hahahaha how do you know me

YOU DONT KNOW ME"
145,INTP,Well shit
146,INTP,"Oh.

Yeah we're definitely socially retarded and environmentally oblivious but at least we're self aware"
147,ENTP,What do you mean be elevated plane? Intellectually?
148,INTP,"High risk, high reward."
149,ENFP,"Hmm. One of my friends is an INTP, and my mom is an ENTJ, so I know a bit about the types. They both enjoy logic and hypotheticals, so I think they could have a lot of fun chatting. I think an ENTJ might get frustrated with an INTP's eclectic habits, the ENTJ wants to rationally plan everything, the INTP's plans make sense to them but seem rather wacky to others. I think if you have a more chill ENTJ and an INTP that's better at communication, it could work"
150,INFP,"Supposedly it's an ideal combination, at least according to the standard mbti compatibility test (switching the outer letters and keeping the ones in the centre)"
151,INTP,That sounds freaking terrifying
152,INTP,"i'm a male intp, one of my closest friends is a female entj. we get along better than most of my other friends, she's someone i value a lot in my life."
153,ISFJ,I don’t think so since they literally do not value any of the same functions
154,INFJ,I also was obsessed with MBTI compatibility eventually. Avoid that. It barely means anything. Enjoy the present moment with your SO and good luck
155,INTP,"Not ENTJ at all but, as an INTP, my last gf was ESTJ, which I think it has some similarities and the relationship was good. We both were rational, used irony and could talk about everything, since politics to celebrities."
156,ENTJ,The ENTJ either has to be really chill or the INTP has to have good communication skills.
157,INTJ,That’s literally my parents
158,ESTP,Yeah I know a couple like this and I think this is how they make it work
159,ENFJ,Is your Dad INFP ?
160,INTP,"One does not simply rely on ""compatibility tests""."
161,INTJ,"It is. My parents are that pairing exactly, and they created an INTJ (me) and an ENTP (my brother)"
162,INTP,"On the contrary, the functions are identical, but opposite polarizations."
163,ENFP,"nope, ENFJ"
164,INFP,How so?
165,INFP,I never said to only rely on that though..
166,INTP,Lol it's the whole gang
167,ENFJ,"Wow,they must have high as fuck expectations for you."
168,ENFP,Still working on lowering those by proving how inept I am :D
169,INFP,I’d guess allot of XSFJs. But my ISFP mum wanted to be one and so did my ISFP friend. It’s also something both me and my INFP sister have been interested in. Also allot of Fs from my experience lol
170,ISFJ,Prob just Fe users in general. Idk what Si and Ni have to do with it so idk why people are listing off ISFJ and ESFJ but not INFJ or ENFJ. Maybe some Se too cuz I’d assume it’s a physical detail oriented job. So ya ExFJ is my best bet
171,ENTP,ENTP here in school for nursing
172,INFP,Yeah my dads an ISFJ and loves talking care of people all the time. He even went into nursing when he was younger. But now he’s a builder because he believes in traditional sex roles and stuff lol
173,ENFJ,"Being a nurse is a people job, so yes to Fe, but it doesn’t offer much if any idea stimulation, so idk why Ni users would be drawn to it. There’s better ways to help people that could utilize Ni in a helpful way. I’d imagine Ni users would be bored, and the very physical nature of the job (always having to focus on the physical environment and do physical tasks) would be tiring. Si on the other hand would excel.

I just looked up an actual study and they concluded there was a preference for sensing (which seems inevitable given that S’s are supposedly so much more common), and thinkers dominated some departments and feelers dominated others, and some departments valued introversion and others extroversion. I think SP’s would also make good nurses, especially in emergencies."
174,ENFJ,"I’m not sure. I didn’t look at actual numbers, just their conclusions, so idk. I doubt they did though. They were pretty reluctant to make any hard conclusions. Despite investigating MBTI in nurses, they refused to talk about any one type and only about the dichotomies separately."
175,ENTP,"Where's my money, bitch"

Apologies for this link, company has content filter for Imgur :("
178,INFJ,"Do you consider yourself a good person? 
Do you believe yourself agreeable/personable? 
Why do you want to know your MBTI?"
179,INFP,"Same thing happenned to me. The first time I took the test, I got INTP. I started reading it, and I thought ""wait, this isn't me at all"" which lead me to think that the test was a lie. 

Back now I found these channels on YT talking about the MBTI types, so I decided to re-do it. Now I got INFP. I read the description and, while I disagreed in certain areas, I definetly found more similarities with myself than I found with INTP. 

I guess that, when I first did it, I had a twisted image of myself, so I answer who I thought I was and not who I really was. 

I guess it's needed to know yourself really well before taking the test."
180,INFP,Reading anything and everything taking every test multiple times sitting in bed for hours thinking about it
181,INFP,"Its hard to say Im a good person, all Ive really done is exist and havent really done anything good so Id say Im in between. Im agreeable and friendly when im in a conversation but I dont seek out conversation much. To be completely honest, I know it sounds corny, but Im learning about my mbti so I know best what I should be doing in life and how to find my place in helping the world and best using my strengths."
182,ISFJ,Or you could just study the functions and decide for yourself rather than having a faulty test decide 🙃
183,INFP,"Thing is I answer honestly and get INFJ but in depth descriptions of INFJ dont make sense to me, like Im not much of a seer and Im not the most extroverted of the introverts. INFP fits better from descriptions I've read but its still not a perfect fit."
184,INFP,"It'll never be a perfect fit. For example, the article said that INFPs are supersticious and are the most likely to get in a polyamorous relationship. Both things for me are completely wrong. However it's the most similar to me that I found."
185,INFP,"Ive read excerpts of his describing the main functions. Should I read his entire work on the types? Probably. Thats probably a good thing to do, Im going to read it when I have time."
186,INFP,"INFPs change all the time, so don't worry if you sometimes get another answer. The test, while hrlpful is still flawed, because the way we perceive ourselves may not be the way we are."
187,INTP,Introverted intuitive intp or infp
188,INTJ,"It's the most jarring difference of all letters, immediately obvious for everyone I meet. No idea how you could be confused about it. Practical no-nonsense here-and-now people vs theoretical dreamers, the biggest divide among humanity."
189,ISFJ,"It’s divided into Ne and Ni, Se and Si.
Ne focuses on potential possibilities that could occur. It’s an interconnected event of situations that could lead into each other in a time flow. Ni focuses on mental impressions of situations. It compares ideas and concepts since it’s objective. Se is about focusing on the literal details. It sees situations for what they are and it’s aware of everything around it. Si is about mental impressions of sensory details. It compares sensory details because it’s a subjective process"
190,INFJ,Some people I know seem to change between the two and it confuses me .
191,ISFP,"Kinda disagree here, I find F vs T much more jarring personally. For example, I get along much better with INFPs than ESTPs for example. Well, depends on the type of F or T. Definitely prefer Fi-Te users overall, so in the case of sharded judging functions I don't really mind F or T.

Even as a PoLR Ne, I can't say I've ever had trouble with a Ne user because of the Ne itself."
192,INFP,"How inspired, a sensor vs intuitive debate."
193,ESTP,"Lol, a ""divide"". Spoken like someone who spends way too much time thinking about this shit. This ain't no hard science. Get over yourself and chill."
194,ESTJ,"Same. F/T is a big deal and easy to spot, and N/S isn't as important. I never have a problem getting along with people just because they're intuitive. FJs are the ones I clash with, whether intuitive or sensing."
195,INFP,IKR!!!
196,INTJ,"BTW, people, THIS is a sensor."
197,ENTJ,Maybe thinking is how science began.
198,ESTP,"Btw, this is someone who ain't shit in the real world. 😎"
199,ESTP,"No matter how many times y’all comment that he’s ENTJ, ESTJ, or ESFJ, it doesn’t change the fact that if I mention I’m ESTP to someone and they google “ESTP famous people,” Trump is the #1 result that comes up.
This is what haunts me."
200,INFJ,"He’s an ESTP, specifically an 8w7 at that. But to keep this on the topic of MBTI: one can see characteristics of Se dominant in him. A particular characteristic of the Se-dominant is a trusting in firsthand experience; in fact, it’s about all one trusts at the end of the day, whether in others or themselves(it’s why Se-dominants respect age so much, because they’ve been through so much more).And in this light would his particular upbringing be made known - a rich guy with perhaps too much influence over others. And so would he come to identify himself in that manner, having lived that life, and thus cause him to become the man he is today. 

A dominant judgment type as suggested, something like a Te dominant, is fallacious simply in that Trump does not lead with judgment. He flip-flops on many things, and while this could be seen as a lack of character by others - he takes things day by day. A judgment dominant would not be swayed by mere circumstances, a Thinking or Feeling dominant would be too rational for that."
201,ESTP,"Unhealthy types are unhealthy, who knew"
202,ISTP,I mean... it's not as bad as having Putin as a fellow ISTP.
203,ESTP,"He doesn’t seem ESTP to me... but no one agrees with me lol

I’m quite frequently asked if I’m a “Trump bro” to which I politely respond fuck no lol

Politics are dumb"
204,ENTP,lmaooo
205,INTP,"there are good and bad versions of each type, he can be used as an example of an unhealthy and narcissistic estp"

209,ISTP,And his wife is an ISTP (sadly)
210,INFJ,He’s pretty ESTP to me . Like my psychology teacher said he’s the kind of person who likes to make people mad because it tickles him . He obviously gets a kick out of making democrats mad . ESTPs are the kind of people who mess with people a lot but never mean nay real harm by it
211,ISFP,I love it.
212,ESTJ,Sucks for you.
213,INFJ,"I don't think we're able to type a person without first dealing with their neurosis. Trump doesn't seem stable in that regard, so to make the assumption that he has any sort of personality preferences would be fruitless."
214,ENTP,"I find myself in a pensive state of mind...Why is Sans Undertale being tormented by Monika from Doki Doki Literature Club? Why is Monika T-Posing, is it because she's an AI? Is spinning around violently in a T-Pose, deemed as a viable strategy in a fight? Has Sans' time-space powers been trumped by an anime girl that resides within a video game? 

Find out on the next episode of Dragonball Zeeeeeeeee."
215,INTP,"There are limitless examples of people with the same type who seem completely different. Hitler and Jimmy Carter. Lenin and Ayn Rand. Himmler and Mother Teresa. Is it that much of a stretch that Trump is the same as, oh say, Hemingway?"
216,ESTP,"why do you care lmao


dude's pretty entertaining"
217,ENTJ,whats wrong with donald trump
218,INTP,I actually think Donald is an ENTJ.
219,ENTJ,Hes an entj
220,ENTP,This has probably been said a million times already but he’s an ENTJ. Calling him an ESTP is a disservice to actual ESTPs.
221,INTJ,"Regardless, he is ENTJ."
222,ENFP,Honestly this just made me better at typing other people as Ps or Js.
223,ESTP,Isn’t Putin INTJ? I don’t know shit about him... but that’s just the way he comes off
224,INTP,The character he played on The Apprentice was ENTJ. But that was fiction.
225,ENFP,what type do you think he is?
226,INTP,Then what is he? ENTP?
227,INFJ,">He doesn’t seem ESTP to me... but no one agrees with me lol

I agree with you, I think Trump is clearly an ESTJ"
228,INTP,😳
229,ESTP,"Oh man, my favorite ex was an INFJ. We had a good laugh looking through all the horrible war-criminals associated with that type"
230,INFP,Who was that then?
231,ISTP,So... was that Hitler or was that Bin Laden?
232,ENTP,"Looks like Sans is the one who is having ""a bad time"""
233,ESTP,His personality is pretty grating to me. I just don’t want to believe we’re too similar lol
234,ESTP,His personality always came across as sleazy and annoying to me. Not how I’d like to be seen.
235,ENTP,lmaoooooooooo
236,INTP,"Yeah, he's too crude for that."
237,ENTP,This response is so on brand with your type.
238,INTP,No he is estp
239,ISTP,"I dunno, he constantly pops up under ISTP at every ""famous ISTPs"" articles and videos."
240,ESTP,"Charm, honesty, and diplomacy are the way to go. Cheat tactics and bullshit aren’t ESTP things mainly because we don’t think or care about them. I think Trump is just being a cunt and acting like an unhealthy ESTP to get better media attention and conservative votes."
241,INTJ,"I've suspected ENTJ for awhile because of his use of Ni as well. Many of his tweets are often looked at as batshit, yet the next thing you know he's got the media talking for a week about the exact issue he brings up in said tweet. The Art of the Deal is basically just the art of war transcribed to a business world."
242,ESTP,My assumption was ESTJ or ENTJ. If he’s ESTP then he’s ridiculously unhealthy. Plus I think it’s a facade to gain votes
243,ESTP,There's nothing even remotely Te about Trump. He's ESTP.
244,ESTP,"I’m leaning toward that too. 
The top results for his MBTI typing says ESTP though, so I felt attacked."
245,ESTP,"I'm Mexican so I find him pretty entertaining, his rallies are something else. It feels like a sitcom.

I made money betting on him winning the first time"
246,INTJ,aaand no
247,INFP,Hitler? Isn't he more of an ENFJ
248,INTP,Donald Trump mostly makes decisions on his own judgment not what others want
249,INTP,"Then again, the way they use hand gestures, the over the top performance character - it’s easy to see Trump and Jones as the same type.

Te-Fi users can’t make believe like Ti-Fe users, it’s Ti-Fe that’s inauthentic. Trying to be relatable, pretending to be a truck driver is something an ESTP would do. It’s the big Se-Fe performance for a crowd."
250,ENFJ,...
251,INFP,"Im really bad as well. That’s why I get a weird positive from exam season because it makes me feel accomplished. But I’d say breaking stuff down.

For example if u want to leave your computer. Instead of thinking of everything u need to do. Set a really small task. Like getting up to get a drink. So if I needed to do an essay I’d tell myself to write the title and see how I feel, and sometimes it worked😂"
252,INTJ,"I write out a to do list that is only three items long with the most important thing starred. Then its like a game, if I get the starred thing done, then I get a reward - get to watch documentary before bed. If I get all three items done in a single day without slacking off or getting distracted, then I get a bigger reward - can play video games during my slack off time. On the other hand if I do none of them, I have to wake up extra early in the morning to get at least the starred item done.

This being said, I haven't played video games in months"
253,INFP,That's a really good advice! Thank you!
254,INFP,You didn't play videogames because you couldn't make all the tasks or because you didn't want to?
255,INFP,Welcome :D
256,INTJ,Because I didn't do all the tasks I needed to do
257,INFP,"Also I tried this app that basically you write tasks and they give you coins to buy ""prizes"". But I always set the coins of the tasks to 1500 to 2000, and the prize to 500 so it wasn't really an achievement haha"
258,INFP,Can relate.
259,INFP,Maybe aiming too far?
260,INFP,Just to mention in case you haven't come across it yet there is an r/infj sub also! Good luck!!
261,INFJ,It’s not pathetic at all. I’ll come back to this later and give you a real answer because everything you’re asking is justified. Of course the only one that knows you best is yourself.
262,ENTP,"29 yo ENTP perspective. I hope that may help you - type does not really matter on this one.

Caring too much - for me as undeveloped ENTP it's kind of a struggle between not giving a damn and going all in.
Not giving a damn is more like self preservation while all in mode is on when you really care and care a lot.

Reall partner... 
I want partner. Lover. Life is a strange place with weird inhabitants. 
For now I'm out of this battle since, funny enough, girls mostly want to have sex. It's probably my fault that I create environment like that. Dunno. Just yesterday I've understood why I'm depressed (even though having fun is not that much of a problem).
I know what I want just haven't found a way to get it. Time shall tell.

Life without sex.. Possible but that highly depends on conditions.
First of all - sex is awesome thing, why limit yourself?
Second of all - I've been into long distance relationships for 4 years and I did like it since I knew that my beloved one is out there and I can talk to her. Eventually she left, oh well.

Relationship as they are are quite a tricky thing.
I want them but for me to have them really deep and fulfilling trust and connection is required. That we can share craziness and silence together.
It's about balance after all.
If you remember one of the first statements I made - if there is care I just go all in. Life is short 🤭

Breakups.
Since when I date I date those who have earned my trust it tends to last. The hardest breakup I had took me 3 years to recover and one fcd up relationship along the way.

Career.
Luckily I knew what I like since 16 so have never done it and I suppose only way it can change that would be to become entrepreneur.

I stand up against something I think is wrong regularly. But since I'm selfish nowadays I'm trying to find most beneficial way to do so. If there is no possible harm to me for standing against smth I'm just saying ""fc you, I'm out, have fun"".

Im always getting consent first. Not in a way ""would you like to fc with me"" but more to the point I'm asked to fc.
You just create environment for that to happen 🤭

Sleeping depends on the schedule I have (meaning none).
Happiness... I can say that I'm fine. But again, I've just started to get out of depression.

Im trying to make myself as cared as possible by myself. Nobody else would do this for me. After all who would like to be with baby? I'm me and I love myself.
I'm starting to do more exercises, eat regularly and so on.

I've changed. For many many years I thought that shell is nothing, my brain matters. Until I've realized that body is as important as brain. In nearly every situation iykwim 😏


It's not pathetic. You just want to understand wtf. I support your curiosity 🤗"
263,INFJ," 

How do you manage caring too much?

\----Since I haven't figured out how to stop caring I've found locking myself remotely away from the possibility to be effective. See long drives, camping, forgetting about my phone, being underwater, doing anything physical that keeps me too preoccupied.

How do you find a real partner and not a project? Is everyone a project?

\----Everyone is looking for their equal and I think we see too much potential with people that are projects. We know what they can be and we need to accept what they are in the current state. Not everyone is a project, I really enjoy people who encourage me to be better and it's like we are each other's cheerleaders. 

What's the longest you've gone without sex? Did it bother you? My longest was 5 years.

\----I don't keep track of time? Does not bother me, just more of a fun thing/in the moment.

Do relationships come easily for you or very very hard?

\----They come easy but are hard to come by. Once that initial chemistry is there it's a home run.

If/when the breakup happens, how long does it take for you to get over it.

\----If a bad relationship that really should have ended months ago then I'm so happy to be free. If a good relationship, it can take a while. 

How many times have you changed your career?

\---Magically it has worked out without changing careers. I did initially go into Biochemistry and towards the end, I really did not like the military targetting me/ethics of chemical weapons really bothered me that I would be contributing to that research. I took a giant U-turn to art and architecture with the help of serendipity and never looked back.

Have you stood up for others or what's right to the detriment of ""getting laid"" ""climbing the corporate ladder"" or ""upsetting a friend""?

\---I am a little too fearless for my own good and have no problem standing up to anyone who purposefully puts others down.

Do you eventually stop trying to help someone help themselves? I do. But not easily.

\----I don't like to stop, but if they really can't imagine the end goal it's nearly impossible to help them.

Do you have any urges or tendencies that you refuse to act out on unless it's complete consent? Like maybe being sexually dominant, kinky, etc. For instance, I can read the body of a partner and know if they like something or not and if they don't, it will not happen.

\----The wording here?

Are you able to sleep?

\----Yes, really helps if I'm exhausted already.

Are you happy?

\----**In the pursuit of wholeness.** I was put into a situation that many doubted I'd be more than a high school dropout. I've overcome that and addiction to having a masters and young successful career. The rest just takes time.

Do you take care of yourself? Workout, eat, sleep, haircuts. Thinking of that shrink...therapist scene of Rick and Morty.

\----I may need reminders here. I've been living off of coffee and alcohol. I find haircuts to be the worst since in woman world it takes forever and is expensive. I am getting better at this as I know I feel better after working out, eating, sleeping, etc.

Have you always been this way or did it change?

\----Somehow I think I was more responsible and organized when I was younger. I am aging in reverse and embracing my inner child.

Is your mind restless?

\----Yes. I think thats why I have turned to opioids and drinking in the past to quiet the mind. Obviously, the less you have to worry about the quieter your mind is so I think things like repetitive exercise, meditation, and mindfulness have really helped."
264,INFP,Crosposting is usually up the rules set by the mods of the sub
265,ENFJ,"It depends on what functions you’re drawn to and enjoy. 

1: ESTP (or ISTP). They have the same functions as ENFJ, just a different order. ENFJ’s drawn to their tert Se will love this dynamic, especially when the ESTP has developed Fe. I’ve only ever dated ESTP’s because it feels so real and natural and comfortable. They’re fine with Ni, they enjoy our dom Fe instead of getting irritated with it, and their Se is refreshingly open minded. They’re not super judgmental (lol except for when they’re mad which is just funny), pretty flexible, which is great for me because I’m opinionated and like doing things my way lol. Married to an ESTP currently and he’s the best man I’ve ever met (more to do with him than his MBTI, but his MBTI is a wonderful perk). 

We just seem to see the world the same way. Se/Fe. We both value people, he likes hearing the stories I collect about people, and he seems to always agree with me and supports me which is great lol. I also love that he’s extroverted too because it makes things way more fun—if he needed alone time I’d be so bored lol. I’ve seen a lot of ENFJ/xSTP relationships so I know this isn’t just me.

2: ENFJ/INFP. If you’re drawn to Ne and really enjoy Fi, this is a great relationship. I personally would never go for this, but I know there are plenty of ENFJ’s that do. It’s nice to be with another dom F who gets what it’s like, but there’s a lot of differences to keep things interesting. You can have deep, intuitive conversations, and Fi/Fe can push each other to grow in their dom function and develop it in interesting ways.

ENFJ would probably take on a somewhat caretaker role because INFP’s aren’t known for being super practical and struggle with the mundane details of life. Fe is a real asset to INFP’s in this case because Fe is so adept at organizing and problem solving. This is the case with my friendship with an INFP. 

3: ENFJ/ENTP. Hypothetically this would be a fantastic fit—Ne *and* Fe! I always thought I’d end up with an ENTP but turns out I prefer Se lol. I’ve never met a mature ENTP though so I can’t speak much to hypotheticals. I’ve never really seen this match IRL (possibly because I don’t know many ENTP’s). 

4: ENFJ/INTP: I hate this pairing. So much. Why in the world would you want to be with someone who doesn’t get your dom function? It’s your primary mode of existence. This is my parents’ relationship, and although INTP loves and values ENFJ’s strengths, ENFJ has withered to accommodate INTP in a lot of ways. They’ve been married for over 30 years but they also seem to lead  parallel lives, not a lot in common (which is admittedly common after 30 years)."
266,INFJ,">..a perfect balance of idealism and realism.

I threw up a little reading this

I'm gonna create some discord by suggesting that we just like to masturbate about how great INFJ description is on 16p"
267,INFJ,How? and why ? that's literally the description given about the INFJ personality type when talking about how our feeling function interacts with our thinking function I'm not pulling this out of my ass. The infj type is described as a thinking feeler so it's not out of the question that the infj is idealistic but also realistic. It's not too rational where it ignores feelings and not too feeler type to ignore realism and rationality.
268,ISFJ,Prob like some Ti dom with like Ne so like INTP because it can imagine all the ways something could go wrong and deduce using systematic logic the ways to figure out how to prevent them. Getting it done quickly might be an issue but at least imo theoretically it would have the best mental capability for the job
269,INTP,Hmm it depends on the situation. Stereotypically ISTJ are known for having a plan for everything cause of how routined and organised they are xP
270,ENFP,"INTJ, but beware, their preparations will likely involve double-crossing everyone and eventually ruling the world"
271,INTJ,How much do you relate to the INTJ stereotypes and how much would you say you consider the intentions of others and brainstorm possibilities?
272,ISFP,">How much do you relate to the INTJ stereotypes

Mostly only the superficial ones, like in the /r/intj memes. Staying indoors a lot, enjoying games, having social anxiety, tend to fall outside of mainstream values and culture, etc. But those are not exactly exclusive to INTJs.

I do aspire to be more like INTJs and ENTJs though, lately I feel like I'm getting more control over my Te when it's needed, and I always welcome Ni insights from both myself and others. Good thing my cousin is an INTJ, we are extremely close and I can take notes from him every now and then.

>how much would you say you consider the intentions of others and brainstorm possibilities?

I'm pretty bad at gouging for intentions, so if I have a vague idea that someone seems a bit off or untrustworthy I'll just automatically assume they might have ulterior motives and keep a safe distance.

As for brainstorming possibilities, it's a bit weird for me. Before MBTI I never did that, but since I found out about Ne and it being my weakness, I find myself much more aware of it, and I try to force myself out of tunnelvisions at important times. However, I always have the feeling that there's something eluding me, so maybe my brainstorming is still quite mediocre and I'm still having tunnelvision."
273,INFP,I’m 18 INFP too:) are you into art. As in painting and drawing?
274,INFP,"Haha not really. I've never been more of an artist than drawing stickman doodles but I'm studying programming so in the future I could make video games and such, I guess that would be my way of expressing my creativity.

It's interesting to see that many ixfps are artists though, do you happen to be one?"
275,INFP,"Oh sounds interesting. Surprisingly I’ve heard allot of INFPs interested in working with computers. And Yeah I am haha :), I was curious because I’m yet to meet one who isn’t."
276,INFP,"Well I can't say from real life experience because I've never met any other infps lol. The closest I have for comparison is my isfp friend who happens to draw aswell, although he specialises in drawing maps and such but they are very detailed and well made. And about the computers part, the reason for infps being interested in that is, in my opinion, probably connected to video games. Us being ixxps makes us a bit geeky with our interests so us recreating our hobbies could be a way of putting our creativity to use."
277,INFP,"I feel surrounded by INFPs but all I have is an INFP twin sister and an INFP as one of my best friends. There both quite art orientated but my friend also absolutely loves video games lol. 

And I completely agree with what you said."
278,ISTP,"Depends on the context. Maybe they were talking nonsense. Maybe they were talking about other things Jung referred to by the word “function” that aren’t cognitive functions in quite the same way as we mean here, as in the transcendent function."
279,ENFJ,"I’d say there’s four categories but eight functions, seeing as Te is nothing like Ti, and Fi is nothing like Fe, etc. Fi is more like Ti than it is like Fe, so saying Fi and Fe are the same function misses the point."
280,ISFP,Isn't the common view that they both count as their own function? Or are you being pedantic about semantics?
281,ISFJ,"meme meme, meme? meme meme!"
282,INTP,How do you feel about typology?
283,ISTP,"I'm still figuring that out, to be honest. I think it's an imperfect system because I don't believe that every single individual can fit perfectly into one of 16 boxes, but at the same time it's a good way to categorize the basic essence of a person. I definitely don't prefer to know someone's type before I get to know them as a person, as I feel that I begin to form pre-conceived notions of what they must be like based on what I associate their type with.

I also feel like typology sometimes allows us to disregard our own flaws, or dismiss them as being characteristic of our types instead of things that we should be working to fix.

Sorry for the long answer but thanks for the question!"
284,ENTP,"I'll quote my own post that I made in r/entp, because I can't be bothered to repeat it (how narcisstic and lazy is that lol, whatever, it's all educational hahaha):

I  don't think I've met one since dabbling with MBTI, but when I was a  teen, there was one girl who I knew through someone else and every time I  was around her, I felt *weird.* Which was weird, in and of itself; I don't feel weird normally (generally speaking, I rarely feel *anything*...until I do).

Now  that I'm older, I've realised that it was because she could see right  through me and my chaotic bullshit with the questions she'd ask: ""What are you *actually* doing for the world?"" ""Your ambition is absolutely fascinating,  but you don't seem to have structure?"" ""You don't actually *like* people, do you? You like what the idea of people getting along looks like in your mind...you like being the **hero** maybe"" shit like that...

Damn, she turned me on so much. Something about not having to put a mask up, is so liberating that I get horny.

But I'm a weirdo.

Edit:  In retrospect, I'm sad that I didn't pursue that further. But I was too busy drunkenly parkouring around Central London and chasing cheap  thrills and easy holes.

Edit #2:  I've just come to realise that I've internalised all of my interactions  with her, as a frame of reference for when I need to do some  introspection. It's allowed me to develop my Fe properly (help the  world), and not just use it to **get what I want from people.** I've grown, yo. *toots own horn*

I guess the main takeaway is that they are probably the best type to help an ENTP grow and better themselves, and perhaps vice versa."
285,ENFP,"Several of my close friends are INFJs, they're all super cute and we get along well.

As an ENFP I like INFJs because if you get close to them, they will be brutally honest and tell you about all the bullcrap they dealt with during the day. It's refreshing and amusing when you get to hear their story of the day through their eyes. INFJs also have a tendency to put the people they love ahead of themselves, and ENFPs like to step in and be like, nooo, you need to take care of yourself as well, and we can help. 

Plus we crack each other up with the dumbest jokes."
286,ISFJ,Kinda hard since you value none of the same functions
287,INFJ,"I heavily agree with the talking out part
But I'm not sure if there's anybody there waiting for me or even thinking of me
""I hate this mood swings either"""
288,INFJ,What’s your opinion on ESFPs at this moment ??
289,INFP,How do you view emotions? Would you ever be able to be close with someone who’s considered an “emotional person” ?
290,ENFP,"Howdy there! 

How would you survive the apocolaypse?

291,INTJ,Your age is?
292,ENFP,What is your favorite meme?
293,INTJ,"We all have our own strengths, their strengths happen to be nearly opposite of mine. That being said, I hate that they focus on emotional sides of an issue, just as they more than likely hate that I focus on the logical side."
294,INTJ,"Emotions are a curse. I try to suppress what I can, especially when I am out in public. It allows me to make calm and collected decisions. However, without emotions, the world simply does not work. I have grown past simply thinking they are idiotic, just that they are annoying.  My best friend is actually an ENFP, so yes, I can be close to an emotional person."
295,INTJ,"Unfortunately, I cannot disclose my plan, as then everyone would know what I would do. 

ENFP's are annoying persistent. They flock to strong emotions and the harder it is to get to them the more interested they are. 

Honesty."
296,INTJ,Older than Reddit.
297,INFJ,As an INFJ stereotypical I tend to think more abstractly  I also think I have my logical side .  I just accept everyone for who they are honestly .
298,INFP,"ENFP/INTJ sounds like an unexpected but good pair. My sisters an INFP and best friends with an ENTP for 3 years and it surprisingly works. 
But yeah I understand the emotions getting in the way thing and agree. Just curious because I know they’re annoying to allot of T types.

I agree that there a curse for allot of things. Thanks for your answer."
299,ENFP,"hmm secret apocolypse plans

So we're like piranhas is what you're saying :D

I agree"
300,INTJ,How long have you known?
301,INTJ,Then you are a better person than I
302,INTJ,"It's more that their emotionally inclined side compliments my logical side. Not so much that they work together, but, I help them with my logic and they help me with their emotional inclination and knowledge."
303,INTJ,More like a dog at Thanksgiving Dinner. Always after the turkey.
304,INTJ,"Since I was able to think consciously and understand time. So, around a year old."
305,INFJ,Never and you know that ! We just have different life paths and ways of thinking ! I envy your logical side of things to be honest but I’m happy the way I am since it’s my life and I feel like everyone has so many possibilities including myself . The goal in life in my opinion is to make yourself proud of yourself not anyone else

ESFJ, not wanting to encounter any gross and/or dangerous creatures, lets her go alone and instead tries to talk to the studying INTP. INTP, while willing to talk, is frustrated when ESFJ confuses physics with psychics.

The INFP quite enjoys her walk alone in the woods. She finds a babbling brook where the sun hits it at the just the right angle that the water has a variety of different colors reflected in it. She also made friends with a squirrel who she named Carlo.

1/ How do you perceive ENFJs? Any advice to give 25M ENFJ me, from your experiences?

2/ Your music taste (genre/artist/song)?

3/ So, what's your story? As in, what's the story that makes you... you today? xD

4/ Any burdens you wanna let out?

Have a nice day!"
333,ESTP,Who are you besides an INFJ?
334,INFJ,How do you let go of people emotionally speaking?
335,INFP,I have an INFJ who is a great friend to me. We have phenomenal conversations and I love her point of view and she's helped me to turn a lot of things around in my head that I was stuck on. I want to be there for her but she is too self-sufficient. I'd love to be a bestie but I also sometimes feel that I'm not that special to her because she's nice to everybody. How do you tell if you're in the inner circle with an infj??
336,INFJ,"That one person sitting in a corner, starring into your soul wondering if you notice how awesome you actually are and what I can do to help you grow as a person, without you actually noticing I had anything to do with it.

Does that count? haha"
337,INFJ,"Haha yea, I'm lurking around most of the time here.

1) I think we do share a lot regarding wanting the world to be a better place, especially showing people the potential which they have. I'm somewhat sure that one of my co-worker is an ENFJ (didn't ask him though) and it's always refreshing to talk about topics. The only thing is, that it feels often from my point a bit too pushy (I guess that's the extroverted nature). I'm not sure what kind of advice I could give you without knowing you, but I think in general it's always a good idea to have a open mind about other personalities. Try to self reflect here and there and do little things which brings yourself and others forward.

2) I have a really mixed taste, from EDM to classical music, to j-pop, to charts or rock. It doesn't really matter if I like the music (so I don't really pay attention on who does what and what is considered cool, until I hear it myself). What I don't like is country like music, techno or loud screaming metal.

3) I think that would be kinda lenghly to write, so I guess I gonna tell you how I come to know that I'm an INFJ. Always felt kinda off towards my friends or strangers I met, didn't really know why. At some point I heard about extroverted and introverted people and got some sort of aha-moment. Easily identified myself as an introvert, but I still kinda ""worked"" differently to other introverts I knew. Years went by and I noticed that a lot don't see patterns and such like I do, I even got a bit worried. Made some autism tests and so on, but those were kinda faulty. After my last break up I did some indepth self reflection which let me to the MBTI. After doing several tests over a span on several months I found out being INFJ. It amazed me that the way I think and feel was so accurately written down, having a name for ""being weird"".

4) No not really, I guess we all have something to struggle with, but after all these years I kinda learned to find a middle ground. Personally I don't like to be an INFJ, a INFP or ENFP would rather be my personal choice.

Thanks for your interest and asking these interesting questions, really appreciate it!"
338,INFJ,"I'm a webdeveloper/designer living in germany. Like to watch anime, movies and tons of shows (netflix, etc), read tons of manga, like to take long walks in nature, inline skate if weather allows it and also have a great passion for game development. And I like to draw (manga), but that kinda slowed down over the years.

Sounds like writing a very bad dating profile haha. If you have additional questions feel free to ask :)"
339,INFJ,"Letting go of people isn't easy, especially if you have fond memories with them. If someone is over the top annoying/insulting and so on it is fairly easy to ""door slam"" them and think like they never existed.

Story is kinda different to people you hold close (family, friends, girl/boyfriend) and it turns out you have to cut ties with one of them or it is getting unhealthy. What helped me in situations like this is to write down things about the situation and the person itself. Like a letter you would write to them, letting them know what went wrong with the situation or the person itself, but never actually send it. It's like processing your emotions and moving on."
340,INFJ,"I would say I'm happy for what I have achived so far, it could always be better, but I appreciate the things I have (close friends, appartment, food, etc). I was rather poor when I was young and had some difficult times in life, so yea I think I have it rather good now. But if you wanna know if I'm happy being INFJ, then it is a rather difficult thing to answer. I like the strengths but I wish my brain could shut up sometimes and stop overthinking every crap that I perceive. And I would like to be a bit more outgoing, I don't dislike being an introvert, but sometimes I wish I could show my emotions and so on more clearly.

I don't have trouble being ""rare"", honestly I don't really care that INFJ is the rarest or whatever. 1% from 7 billion is still 70 millions. I don't really think that any of my friends is INFJ, so I can't tell how it would be to talk someone being like me. But it is rather interesting writing on reddit and so on with fellow INFJ and sharing experiences, like we do now.

About the superman kryptonite question, yes in the past I have clearly overstepped my boundaries hurting the person I cared for and myself. But I learned my lessons (mostly) over the years and be way more careful now.

The longest without sex would be the time I was not in a relationship, which is dunno 2-3 years maybe? I don't do one night stands or things like that, because I prefer close personal relationships for that matter.

My physical appearance is kinda ""normal"" I would say? I'm rather short for a man, but that's fine. I like to do sports here and there, but I'm not overly athletic. People tend to tell me I have a cold or distanced aura going on, but once they now me it is getting warmer. I don't think I'm very attractive, but I also tend to critisize myself like crazy, so I probably couldn't even tell, even if I would be considered attractive.

&#x200B;

>How do you cope with the world as it is?

I developed some sort of tolerance to a lot things, but I'm also very stubborn and want to change the status quo. I believe small acts of kindness and supporting people can help everyone in the long run. I would like to do way more things, but I often bury myself in to many ideas and thoughts that I have to kick myself to actually do something.

&#x200B;

> This woman I talked to for 6 hours made me think to try Reddit. Why not. 

Well then welcome to reddit, nice to meet you! Hope you enjoy it and thanks for the interesting questions :)"
341,ESFP,Not what I expected but happy anyways hahah
342,INFJ,He knows too much now....shhhhhh
343,ENFJ,"Thks for sharing your stories! You're like my INFJ friend... but older/wiser... (in a good way, no offense) xD

1/ Thanks for the advices! I feel INFJs are the best advice support for us ENFJs, since you guys are more prudence, thus have a wider view than us.

2/ I too have a wide variety of music taste, but most of them have a common trait that they're eccentric/exotic to others xD Guess XNFJs have that in common as well

3/ This is really cool, as my friend went through that exact period back when we were in uni. Good thing she found out about her self-worth and how to use her understanding of people and emotions to become a mental advisor. What's your occupation if I may ask?

4/ Well being careless is hard, innit? xD"
344,INFJ,The processing part is what gets me. I then start picking up on more detail that I may have missed. Oh well. Have you found a good way to turn off your thoughts? Asking as a younger INFJ that needs to go to sleep at a normal time. Or so you have any advice for a younger 25 year old you in general?
345,INFJ,"Out of curiousity, what did you expect? :)

I mean putting a personality in one sentence is kinda difficult for me. There are tons of facettes, but I like to see myself as a ninja-hiding-in-the-shadows-cheerleader haha.

Of course there are other strengths and weaknesses like reading people like books, lie detectors, door slamming, self critizing, saviour complex and so on. But well that's boring to write xD"
346,INFJ,"Oh I wouldn't take that as an offense, kinda the opposite it's a very kind compliment. Thanks for that :)

1) Yea that could be the case, but I think what you can do way better is to get like minded people together and thus flourish an idea. While we INFJ tend to think about what could make the world and so on better, you are the ones taking actions way faster than us and that is pretty awesome to say at least. I think an INFJ + ENFJ are really good problem solvers working together in a team.

2) I think that could be the case yes, I can't really decide on one music direction and like to have very mixed playlists with different music than themed lists which are like ""happy"" or something.

3) After I came to an understanding of my strengths and weaknesses it definetely started to help feeling better with myself and use these skills for a greater cause. It's not always working, but I'm trying. I do work as an web developer/designer. But also had a team leading position so I get where that mental advisor thingy is coming from. I love to see people grow and see how awesome they are, this is the best kind of happiness for me.

4) Absolutely, overthinking to the maximum. I tend to write tons of letters and whatnot to sort my million thoughts out. It's kinda tiresome, but you learn to tone it down :)"
347,INFJ,"I think you will never completely be able to stop overthinking. I also have insomnia because of that since being a kid. What personally helps me is reading or doing stuff which distracts you until you're able to sleep. A lot prefer meditation or a workout, the last one would be bad for sleeping though.

It really is important that you find activities which keep you busy, or ways to spend energy over the day that you dead tired when you have to sleep. It's not easy, but you'll slowly be able to decrease the amount of thoughts."
348,ESFP,Like with most J types I thought about judging people silently or something like that.
349,ENFJ,"Yah, my INFJ friend was also a member of my uni'd student council, that's how we met, since we worked in the same team, her being the leader as she's one year ahead of me. Over the course of a year, she stepped down and put me in charge instead, as she felt I could handle the team better, so that she could focus entirely on planning.

We had some good chemistry working together, and I love it! But I love working with ESFJ more, since they are more down-to-earth. Working with INFJ, we tend to be too creative for our own good, missing specific fundamental details sometimes xD

Anyway, it was good sharing things with you! Have a really nice day, kind sir :D"
350,INFJ,"I see, makes sense seeing it that way. I would say it is kinda controversial for INFJ. That J is not really judging towards others, but ourselfs. I really don't judge people and be as open minded as possible until I see every perspective. And only after that I draw a conclusion about something and thus can be judging (if ever at all).

At least this is how I perceive it. Not sure if this is common for INFJ or not though."
351,INFJ,"I can totally see that happening with having to much creativity around instead of really being productive haha.

Also thanks for the interesting feedback, wish you a nice day, too!"
352,ISTP,"Which way does the door open? But without knowing, you likely can easily slide in some cardboard or prop something up so when you open it nothing crashes and instead slides down. Tho tbh would probably ignore it till I *really* needed something in there

Also who the fuck stacks bowls in cabinets like that to cause that mess in the first place"
353,INFP,id buy some new plates and a new cabinet and just leave that there for someone else to deal with
354,ENFJ,"Yes they do.

The first to react, with action and with emotion as well. Fierce, powerful, but easily go out, like a flame.

It's really cool to see them in action :D"
355,ISFJ,Damn that Ni
356,INFP,"Very similar to America today actually.

At the moment, American society is tailor-made for ESTJs (especially males) and, subsequently, is detrimental towards INFPs due to misplaced values in productivity at all costs and unnecessary bureaucracies. For this reason, INFPs (artists in general) are having a lot of trouble progressing in our country due to damn near blatant levels of exploitation.

Most people would feel like something was missing in their lives but they just couldn't quite place their finger on it. Since INFPs are known for giving the underdogs a much-needed lift in mood, happiness would not only go down, but it would stay down. Suicide rates would slowly, but surely rise with no signs of stopping. Production would go up but then start to decrease as motivation goes down (and stays down).

*tl;dr:* INFPs main role in society lies in mental health in some fashion (whether through medicine, art or something) so that would be the main thing to deteriorate. It would also take a while for people in power to notice the effects of our absence."
357,ENTP,"The INFP is society’s moral compass. You guys live in the clouds, dreaming of an ideal utopian world which is generally unrealistic. But because of this, your philosophy deepens and evolves through time, stronger than any other type is capable of. This eventually leads to you INFPs holding yourselves and others to an incredibly high personal standard of conduct. At the same time, you worry that others won’t be able to live up to it. If INFPs can get out of their comfort zone, they can bring this ideal world to life.

INFPs are the true philosophers of society. Without them, a society would become alienated from its own morality, never really understanding what lies beneath."
358,ISFJ,Don’t think that’s how it works
359,ISFJ,Well you went off dichotomies lol. That overwrites any of the accuracy in your post you aimed for
360,INFP,"Dichotomies are fine in the context of his post. If we are talking in general you can seperate extroverts, sensors, etc. Functions are necessary for specifics like confirming a type so I don't see what the problem with his post is"
361,ISFJ,"No not really. The E vs I and P vs J don’t even work as dichotomies because they don’t represent any specefic individual concept. Sensing vs Intuitive and Thinking vs Feeling do, but that in of itself is still split. So no. It doesn’t work in the context of this post and that’s why MBTI Reddit is fucked"
362,INFP,"Actually they do repressent something. In your cognitive stacks whatever functions you have fall under different categories. There is the category of extroverted functions like Fe, Ne, Se etc. You also have the percieving functions of Intuition and Sensing aswell as the judging functions of Feeling and Thinking. What decides those outer letters is which ones overlap the more. If you lead with an extroverted function and your 3rd function is extroverted aswell (2nd and 4th are always introverted in this case) you are an extrovert. And whether the combination of your percieving or judging functions are stronger decides which one you are. Let's take your type for example. Isfj has Si Fe Ti Ne, your dominant function which beats your auxiliary is introverted and your teritary which beats inferiour is introverted aswell. That's why you are isfj instead of esfj who have Fe Si Ne Ti (notice how 1st and 2nd;3rd and 4th have been switched as for the extroverted to be stronger). Now lets see how you are different from you perciever counterpart the isfp. Isfp have Fi Se Ni Te, while the stack is ordered like the esfj (because its their dual) their order of introverted and extroverted for each function is the exact oposite of yours because J and P flip the extroversion/introversion of each function, and what decides that they are a perciever is the fact that while they lead with Feeling (which is a judger function) their other judging function which is their thinking is the last and weakest one so the auxiliary combined with teritary (both being perciever functions) win out in the end. These are pretty much the explanations for E/I and P/J sorry for the chaotic wall of text but I'm writing this at 1 am."
363,ISFJ,"well im sorry but you wasted your time. no shit thats what it is. but that wasnt my point. instead of wasting your time writing that entire paragraph, you could have just carefully read what I said. I said they don't represent a SPECIFIC concept. The I/E and J/P differ from Sensing, Intuition, Thinking, and Feeling because they only just play into the order of the functions, but dont actually present a SPECIFIC type of of function. If someone is an xxxP, what's that gonna say? That they have 4D/3D Ji/Pe functions. But if thats literally all your point, how tf does that connect to your first point about that making sense in the real world context. It doesnt. Same with Ixxx. Doesnt mean shit other than your stack will go I, E, I, E. thats why they represent no SPECIFIC concept. they just represent the order of your functions, which doesnt say much, compared to S/N and T/F. Also to correct you, you said ESFJs and ISFPs are duals which is not the case. They are contraries. The dual of ESFJ is INTP, and the dual of ISFP is ENTJ"
364,ISFJ,Who gives a shit at this point. Trying to break type population by faulty logic is dumb. Nobody would ever run serious research on types popularity. Every single research contradict each other.
365,ENFJ,"MBTI statistics are based on MBTI, not Jung. MBTI changed Jung’s interpretation of Si drastically, from eccentric to classically SJ traits (traditional, practical, etc). What MBTI describes as ISFJ would then be the most common type (if statistics are to be believed)."
366,INTP,Can we talk about the fact that nearly half of all women are SFJs?
367,ESTP,"spe·cial
/ˈspeSHəl”/
adjective
adjective: special
better, greater, or otherwise different from what is usual.
""they always made a special effort at Christmas"""
368,ENFJ,"I’m Ni aux. Ni drives me to ask why something is the way it is, what is behind it. I’ll wonder and question, and then all of the sudden, I’ll get an epiphany—stars will align, and I’ll know with absolute certainty why things happen the way they do. 

Ni is all about recognizing patterns. Because I’m ENFJ, the patterns I’m interested in are people related. So, a pattern I might pick out is “insecurity” or “depression” or “confidence.” If someone asks me why I think what I think, however, I don’t usually have a lot of concrete answers lol. “Uhhhh idk, I just *do.* “ 

Part of Ni is unconscious. Because it’s abstract, it makes little leaps and bounds in logic, based on previous discoveries and opinions. I’ve gotten better at figuring out why I believe my Ni conclusions, but that’s taken a lot of effort. Ni is like trusting “your gut.”"
369,ISFP,"As a Ni tertiary user, it's like a flash, an insight, suddenly showing something behind the scenes, to know the unknown, to see the problems inside, and the future becomes transparent, you can see through the timeline... well but it doesn't happen to me often lol, only in some special magical time it appears randomly."
370,INFJ,"Compare to Si.         
          
Ni is like Si in that it gathers information internally.  It does not make any decisions.  It is passive.        
         
However, it does not collect sensory information like sight, smell, taste, etc.      It abstracts those things into simpler, easier to understand information like overall concepts, or relations to other things.    It discards the raw information itself.            
          
Say you're recalling an Italian restaurant you ate at once.   Would you remember the actual color of the table cloth and the smell of the food? Could you see it in your mind's eye and smell it in your head?  Or would you reconstruct it using base information? ""It was an Italian restaurant. It must have smelled like pasta and the tablecloth was probably checkered like every other Italian restaurant.""         
          
There are advantages to each.   An Si user, for instance, still has access to the RAW information.  They actually know what the tablecloth looked like because they can picture it.  ""Wasn't that the one Italian restaurant ever with a purple tablecloth?"" An Ni user has only the concepts and is likely to forget the actual details of what happened.  It causes inaccuracies in fine details of the past if they're unimportant.   An Si user doesn't have flawless memory but it's not condensed the same way.        
          
However, all that information is usually way too much to consider.  An Ne user almost always has trouble predicting outcomes with certainty, in part, because they have a LOT of information to work with, and it's too much to sort through using a judgement function like Ti.           
            
 An Ni user's base concepts and abstracts make it easy to zero in on what's important in that information and to match it with other things.  We basically pull in information by relating things to other things.   In contrast, this makes it very easy to understand this information and make decisions with it using a judgement function like Ti.    We don't have to remember the fine details to make future base choices because we remember the concepts and see how they fit together, then fill in where needed using other functions.       
            
Incidentally, this is also why we're to be heard saying, ""shit. I know exactly what's going on.  There's a word for it.   It's called.   ....""*checks Google for ten minutes*"
371,INTJ,"Trusting your gut, generalizing, forming a thought process, paying attention to what keeps you alert, and wanting to find out more."
372,INTJ,"It's like ummm....

I can see years into the future. 

I decide that I want to not work anymore. 

What can I do when I am not working...? I can do more shit. 
 
Then I come back to 2019 and ask myself. What do I need to do to get where I want to be in 2025?

Then I start to zoom in all the little details that would get me there. 

Damn it's hard... Imagine taking all the information from past and present and predicting the future. Usually correct. 


I ask myself. What if I do this... Then this will happen... And if I impliment this... It will change to this... So avoid that so it doesn't go that way....


Grrrr...

Imagine a flow chart about life ... If I make this decision.   Where will it take me... Okay... I don't like where that will take me.. step back... Go the other way....

But I am not actually literally doing it. I am thinking about what would happen if I choose this or that path."
373,ENFJ,"Auxiliary Ni due to ENFJ. Simply put it, I always try to think ""Wtf is going on..."" in every situation...

So, Ni is your inner feeling/thinking, which is used to accessing situations. If it's your main function, it helps you evaluate, planning prior to your actions."
374,ESTP,Ni takes a bunch of Se data points and finds a model of best fit for them unconsciously.
375,INTJ,"Imagine all your knowledge and experiences are dots.

Some pepes have alot of dots, while others have less.

Ni draws connections subconsciously between the dots based on relevance.

The relevation pops into the conscious and you go 'ah ha!'.

Occasionally this synthesizes new dots.

The more dots you have, the easier it is for Ni to web up the connections. Hence a thirst for knowledge and experiences.

The stronger the Ni, the more frequent and complex these connections are.

Im other words, pattern recognition and knowledge synthesis."
376,INFJ,"I don't think timeline is precisely the differentiater between Ne and Ni, though there's probably a correlation.         
          
Ne takes a single concept and branches out from there to view multiple possibilities.  Those possibilities then Branch out to create more ideas.  It's effectively it's exponential.   All of those ideas then have to be filtered with a judgement function to remove the unlikely, ridiculous, or amoral ideas (depending on which judgement function is used to filter.)  The metaphor is the trunk of a tree branching out into branches which then branch out again.       In essence, it generates chaos so that that chaos can be filtered down to find good ideas.         
           
Ni takes multiple concepts and condenses them into a single concept.  It pulls concepts from a vast store which is already condensed and organized for easy access.    It thrives in chaos because it's good at taking that chaos and making it cohesive.   The metaphor here is the roots of a tree pulling water into the trunk.          
              
Ne is more concrete in that it is aware of the present reality that there are multiple future options due to multiple variables.         
          
Ni is more concrete in it's belief of the eventual outcomes.   They stay in flux, constantly readapting as more information is pulled into the fold.  But, there's only ONE thread.               
               
We refine this thread and correct it using our judgement functions just like Ne users filter out bad branches.    This will tend to mean that we are very sure, and tend to have motivation to manipulate the present to alerter that thread in the future.              
                
The Ne user is in the present moment viewing multiple possible outcomes and making judgements to decide on a branch.         
            
The Ni user is rarely in the present alone.  We see the past, present, and future as a single chain of events and attempt to manipulate the future outcome.  This feels like viewing three versions of yourself from the outsider's point of view.  You're almost an observer on your own life."
377,INFJ,"Yes, it's entertaining how blind spots are blind spots.  =T"
378,ENFP,Um.. isn’t that just normal
379,ENFP,I wouldn’t consider noticing your “thinking and feeling” to be magic powers 😂
380,ENTP,"But they're right though? Discussion and debate should not be synonymous with discussion and debate that lacks a true education on the subject matter. i.e. people shouldn't discuss the MBTI as an absolute, when it is clearly only a superficial guideline into an individual's psyche. Doing so would be ignorant, counterproductive and arguably detrimental to that person's ideology (and therefore by extension, the collective ideology of the MBTI community itself), as thinking and behaving this way is *shamefully* narrow-minded."
381,ESTJ,"Factors that aren't due to type still affect people's behavior and preferences. Not taking those into account is how stereotypes and typing mistakes happen.

Part of the point is to figure out what's from type and what's from something else. If you know which weaknesses are normal for your type and which ones aren't, it's easier to find effective ways to work on them."
382,ENFP,"It’s true that typology can’t explain everything, but commenting that on every post on a subreddit dedicated to MBTI is kind of pointless"
383,ENTP,"True, not every post, that would be mundane and would eventually propel this whole MBTI thing into 100% meme status. But to me it just boils down to the fact that it would be a lot worse, if nobody said anything at all... ironically, possibly even achieving the same meme-like connotations (I'm aware it's pretty meme-y already); I'd rather live in a world where people question the nature of things, than just accept it blindly because it's ""cool"" or ""safe"".

You're right, more elaboration should go into one's arguments, in order to help others' comprehension of themselves in regards to everything in the MBTI. I normally try my best to."
384,ENTP,You're right.
385,ENFJ,Why X? Is it because you're uncertain or for privacy reasons?
386,INFP,How important is leadership to you?
387,ESTP,What do you think about ESTPs?

389,INTJ,Hobbies?
390,ESTP,"An 18 year old thinking he's some intuitive misunderstood genius over the internet, what you expect? Lol."
391,ENFJ,Care to elaborate on it so we can help you out?
392,ENFJ,"What you described is common for NJs as well as both Te-Ni functions, so I can't really figure out which function would you prefer over the other.

Do you find yourself react promptly to situations? As in take action instantly when you see a problem; verbally spoken out before something absurd, then rejudge it later?"
393,ENFJ,Do you have this specific need to be in control? Do you have a problem with taking the driving seat in the team? Do you prefer working alone or as a team?
394,ENFJ,"I've got a feeling that you rely on your Ni before your Te, friend, as you don't seem to have the tendencies to respond immediately due to reaction, like most ENXJs do. You seems to be more prudence, control over yourself before acting, which shows that Ni kicks in first.

You may feel urges to research/do some thing, this is due to your auxiliary Te, which supports Ni in finding new knowledge/skill/solution.

This, of course, is only my assumption based on your sharing, please only take it as a reference :D"

Which types of mental disorders do you think ENFPs would be most likely to have?"
406,INFJ,Well I just  love how ENFPs accept us for who we are and don’t look at us like weirdos like almost everyone else
407,INFJ,">Well I just  love how ENFPs accept us for who we are and don’t look at us like weirdos like almost everyone else

😕 not all enfp's"
408,INTP,Good point. Sometimes they’re a bit too cocky for you.
409,INTP,Why are there never any enfp’s in liquor stores?
410,ENFP,"Yay XD

I love having the attention span of a gnat"
411,INTP,Cause they don’t allow free spirits.
412,INTP,I make a lot of enfp jokes at my enfp friend. This is all I can remember at the moment. Lol
413,INTP,How many enfps does it take to change a lightbulb?
414,INTP,Why didn’t the enfp know she was pregnant?
415,INTP,How come there aren’t many enfps in insane asylums?
416,INTP,How do you know enfps take a lot of selfies?
417,INTP,What’s an enfp and an intj’s favorite class together?
418,INTP,Why do enfps make the best strippers?
419,INTP,Why did the dyslexic enfp set off the fire alarm?
420,INTP,They don’t know it needs to be changed. The room just lights up when they enter.
421,INTP,Cause she is always late anyway.
422,INTP,Because they’re rarely ever committed. (Used this on istps as well 😝)
423,INTP,Cause you can always find their head in the Iclouds.
424,INTP,Chemistry. 😉
425,INTP,They’re gonna start dancing the second they see glitter anyway.
426,INTP,They opened the emergency excite door.
427,INTP,"Jesus, you replied to all of them! 😂"
428,INTP,Not always true but stereotypes are funny. 😊
429,ENFJ,"My gf is INFP, one of my good friend is INFP, and they're the dreamers/artists type. Which means they're really sensitive when it comes to art/feelings. They can cry/get emotional at literally anything you can name really... I'd be surprised they can fry an egg without crying of how beautiful the yolk is..."
430,ENTJ,I have this problem... with you. >:|
431,INFP,Me
432,INFP,How often are you bored during work? Do you like your job?
433,ESTP,What do you think about ESTPs? What’s your job?
434,ISTP,"Depends? I was kinda dragged into a bank at the beginning of the year, and I've just been hopping around departments depending on where needs help. There was a mixup with where I'm going next, so haven't had much work to do rn.

And it's not my favorite, usually they know enough to keep me away from the customers but it doesnt always happen. Just waiting to save up enough money to move and potentially get into a carpentry career"
435,ISTP,"Yas are good in bed for starters. Fun to hang out with, especially since the ESTPs I've known tend to know what they want to do so I can just follow along as let you guys talk. A bit tiring after a while tho lol

Currently in a bank, but I've gone from department to department depending on where needs help"
436,ESTP,Okay ask me anything
437,ESTP,Don't remember
438,ESTP,"Martial arts

Dr Strangelove

Metallica"
439,ENTP,"Let's be honest, we'd design it but never actually finish it."
440,ENTP,"Needs to have a large shower with acoustics, so I can listen to myself win imaginary debates."
441,INFJ,It’s part of a series of architectural designs for the 16 types
442,INTP,Both.
443,ENTJ,"Neat! :D

I can't want to see INTJs lair, you should put it under our castle.~"
444,ENTJ,What is the reason for which you wake up in the morning?
445,ESTP,What. Do. You. Think. About. ESTPs.
446,ENTP,"How do you experience Te?
Also, if you were your evil twin the ENTP for a day, what would you do?"
447,ISFJ,"When I meet an ESFP, there is always initial *insane* chemistry."
448,INFJ,ENFP + INFJ or ENTP + INFJ.  I never gave mbti much of a chance until I looked into it and started seeing patterns like this where you just instantly click.
449,ISTP,ISFP & ISTP.
450,ENTJ,"ESFP: Na

ENTJ: H^(2)O

Hella chemistry."
451,ESFJ,"I think most people would say that Sensors get along well with other Sensors, iunno. Often when i look up type compatibilities i see that, but in my own experience i seem to relate to Intuitives better.

Or maybe someone out here has a better analysis of what kind of people would have the most chemistry with an ESFJ?"
452,INTJ,"ENFPs are my aphrodisiac.
ENTPs are my caffeine.
INFJs are my depressants."
453,ENFP,"ENTJs drive me crazy and vice versa, in every sense of the term."
454,ENFP,ENxPs and INxJs explosion every time lol. Having an intuitive dom function makes everything more fun 😜
455,INFJ,I’m an INFJ and my crush and friend is an obvious ENFP ! I just love how happy and silly she is while also having a dark sad  side to her . I just can’t help but really want to help her and care for her even if she doesn’t need it
456,ISFJ,Ditto
457,INTJ,Explosive
458,ENFJ,"Interesting. I like Te/Ni, but they’ve never really seemed to like my Fe lol. But I adore ENTJ’s because I relate to them so well (even if they don’t relate to me)."
459,INFJ,Well if you come home one day and find an NF that snuck into your soul then you will know.
460,ENFP,You should look into it more. There are many instances on reddit and I have my own experience with it too. Usually they either love us or hate us.
461,ENFP,"Did you create this thread to genuinely hear other people’s opinions or confirm your own? 😂

I never dismissed your belief that nfjs and ntjs have tremendous potential for growth. I’m just saying what I observe from my own experience and reading because idk about and I can’t speak for other types. For me, NFPs and NTJs have an immediate, flaming connection and I’ve heard of plenty that become long-lasting and fulfilling. It all depends on the individual people."
462,ENFP,Yikes I read the whole thread. That person made some gaslighting and manipulative comments before deleting it lmao 🧐
463,ENFP,Makes me shiver...Never have I seen the power of a manipulative INFJ until now
464,ENFP,"Aight, it seems like you have an unrequited something with an entj and you’re seeking validation of your intense residual feelings here. You edited your comments multiple times too. Since you’re not really interested in hearing other people’s experiences, I wouldn’t waste more time justifying mine, because 1. I don’t need to and 2. ENTJs choose whoever the hell they want; it’s strange for you to start this fight with me to “claim” a type. I was never here for it, I’m here to share my perspective, gee 😂

Edit to your edit: if you “really don’t need others’ opinions on this topic,” why even make this thread title? Why just not name it “NFJs and NTJs are most compatible and here are my reasons why?” Strange redditor you are"
465,ENFP,"Nah, you deleted your comments because they contain everything I refer to and you cannot twist them however much you edit your comments.

I’m not gonna address your projections on me cause I really can’t give less of a shit what you think 😁"
466,ENFP,"Maybe try actually giving a solid argument instead of just attacking a whole Mbti type and using insults... 

That projection in your comment is crazy.

If you’re meeting a lot of “bad” enfps I hate to break it to you but the problem might be you.. 

that just gives me more reason to believe you’ve been arguing a lot lol so ig that’s what you do

And yes I saw some of your comments before you deleted it and I’m glad you did because they were really immature. Just like this recent one.

If you’re done with the whole “ENFPs suck” fallacy, projections, and insults then maybe I’ll respond. Otherwise it’s pointless. 

Never thought I’d meet an unhealthy INFJ I’m almost inclined to ask about an INFP mistype.. because you sound like unhealthy Fi. Which I guess would be ironic"
467,ENFP,"Alright, so speak your truth. Don’t speak for others."
468,ENFP,"If I were butthurt, I would be resorting to insults, gaslighting and deleting comments. Save yourself some grace. You're starting to get obsessed."
469,ENFP,"I’m not even going to acknowledge your “argument” points. I don’t even need to, it’s just innately ridiculous. They’re just emotionally projecting attacks void of any logic. 

At this point there is no way you don’t see your projection. You’re not even making an effort to not sound butthurt as you’re calling others butthurt.

Notice I haven’t called you psycho, a clown, a troll, jealous, little “chuckies” whatever that means, etc. 

You using less insults and more coherent logic would be nice, but you do you.

I really would recommend not using Reddit anymore. Also, if you want people to “side” with you like you said, you have to use legit arguments and not resort to emotional name calling and insults. No one likes that stuff. 

This isn’t kindergarten.

There’s no way you’re an INFJ I promise.. they use tertiary Ti for logic in their arguments, and you’re just pure emotion which indicates unhealthy Fi dom"
470,ENFP,"My god...the speed and degree to which you edit your comments...I’m out, you’re right, ~~I don’t fuck with insecure gaslighters~~ I complete agree with you 😆👍 Only nfjs and ntjs can have both intense chemistry and true long term potential for growth and transformation. Truly a match made in heaven. I hope you find a perfect entj for you."
471,ENFP,Show me then. All of my original comments are there and they speak for themselves.
472,ENFP,"You sent me a whole incoherent essay and then say you’re not taking me seriously... okay then 

You’re just trying to cop out now since I called you out on your bs.

Welp I’m embarrassed for you .

Peace ✌🏽not responding after this but you’re free to keep trolling and entertaining yourself"
473,ENFP,"Girl, you revised entire paragraphs to gaslight me and other people reading whenever I point out your partial judgment and personal attacks. I’m exiting this conversation immediately so no need for further resentment. Exit this thread, take a breath, good luck."
474,ENFP,"Again, all of my comments are untouched and they speak for themselves. Thanks for proving my point with your behavior. I suggest rereading what you just wrote later and edit it per usual so you don’t sound like a psycho."
475,ESTJ,"Make sure it's a judgment-free zone when you're together. I know I sound crazy being an ESTJ talkin about ""judgement-free"" but I was in a relationship with an INTJ and If I could go back I would've tried to establish that from the get go. It's so important not to pour more into the relationship than the other person."
476,INFP,"Almost every one of the meltdowns I've seen in this relationship happens when the INTJ disagrees with something that the INFP is emotionally attached to. It's a situation that's almost unavoidable and requires way more patience than either side is usually willing to give. It'd be impossible for me to give details without sounding biased, as I've had personal experience in this situation myself, but it is definately a struggle. If they do however, get past that massive hump, it would be absolutely worth it though."
477,INTJ,From personal experience it doesn't work out. Once the honeymoon phase wore off it fell apart slowly but surely. She couldn't have any constructive argument. Hope you can find a way to make it work
478,INFP,I think is impossible to an INTJ not to judge things haha
479,ESTJ,Not all was her fault. Get real.
480,INTJ,"Kinda. If anything I was the one trying to help her improve herself, maybe a little too much at times. I kind of ended up helping her run her life for a little because she had a lot of things come up at once (moving cities, switching jobs, friend trouble, etc) so I rarely had any time left over for personal development.

The biggest issue was she would react very emotionally over problems/situations that I considered to be non-issues or at least manageable/fixable. We could not find enough common ground to see eye to eye on things to the point where certain topics just became taboo (a lot of the issues came down to her and my friend group not getting along). In hindsight one of my failures was that after several non-productive arguments I stopped trying to get to the root cause of what was bothering her and just did whatever I could to try and make her happy. Eventually this led to resentment between the two of us which caused us to drift apart."
481,INTJ,No shit lol the point is we were incompatible
482,INTJ,Or you have the emotional awareness of a goldfish.
483,INTJ,"You're welcome. Honestly I don't think she was a very healthy INFP (not saying I was perfectly healthy at the time either), she had a lot of things go wrong for her in life and I'm not sure she ever developed proper coping mechanisms. I could see two healthy mature people finding a way to make it work - there's definite chemistry between the two types. The first few months with her were hands down the best time I've ever spent with someone in my life."
484,INTJ,OK bud
485,INTJ,"It sounds like you've got a much better foundation than I had haha. Every relationship needs to be an even two-way street, ours became mostly me -> her. Again a lot of that was due to life circumstances outside of her control but after a time I felt my actions and effort spent helping her were being taken for granted. The fact that you're pushing him for improvement where he's weak and vice versa bodes well for the long term.

I will say the biggest pet peeve I had - when you notice he's going out of his way to do something nice for you, however mundane, that's his way of showing affection/love so don't be overly critical if they're not done in the exact way you'd like!"
486,ENFP,"A) Te or Te+Ni

B) Te/Ti (both do this)

C) Te (organized logic using given facts)

D) Ne or Ne+Ti

E) Definite Ne (makes rapid connections, analogies)

F)Ti or Ti+Ne (not sure about this one)

G) Ne/Ni or Te/Ti (most conceptual functions can do this)"
487,INFP,Too me seems mostly like an Ne + Ti combo. Or the other order.
488,INFP,What's your dream job? Is your dream job your current job or at least on the way there?
489,ESTP,WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ESTPS?
490,ENFJ,"1/ Are you M or F (or LGBT)?

2/ Favorite music genre/artist/song?

3/ Do you find yourself emotional/sentimental?

4/ Your ideal romantic partner type? Why?

5/ Thoughts on ENFJs? xD"
491,ESFP,"I would like to be a Judge, I am not there rn but I am in law school so I hope I get there someday."
492,ESFP,"I DON'T KNOW MAN, I DON'T LIKE WHEN YOU GO FULL NARCISSISTIC BUT MOST OF THE TIME WW ARE VERY SIMILAR SO I HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH ESTPS AND I LIKE THEM A LOT."
493,ESFP,"1/  I am a dude, I should have said so in the title

2/ I listen mainly to Hip Hop/ Dembow/ Reggaeton but honestly I just like anything fast-paced. 

3/ Yes, I have always been very emotional and empathic, even with people I don't know/ don't like.

4/ I find myself attracted to INFPs mostly, they have a understanding and soft side that I like a lot.

5/ I love ENFJs! they always do what they must  and are very caring and respectful for other people, 2 of the traits I most admire in a person."
494,INFP,Wow! Hopefully you'll get there
495,ENFJ,"2/ Wow most ESFPs I know are also party animals/listen to fast-paced like EDM, Hiphop etc... Best way to express your Se I think xD

3/ So do my ESFP friends lol... The firsts to react to any situation, with fierce and emotions xD So cool to see them in action!

4/ My gf is INFP, also have an INFP close friend. They're really sentimental dude. They cry over how beautiful the horizon is. Heck they'll cry over how beautiful their omlette is xD (lol jk)

5/ Thx dude ;D

Have a fantastic day my man!"
496,ESFP,Thank you!
497,ESFP,You too dude!
