31,immvrtxl,LetsNotMeet,INTJ,"MtG!!! Do you play EDH? I love MtG. Also, the grabbing of the wrist gesture is definitely worthy of self defense. If anyone grabs you by the wrist you are in danger. I would have, after that, kept pepper spray or bear mace on me at all times. Whenever I see someone sketchy hanging out in a parking lot I don't even get out of my car I just drive to the next store. Scary stuff."
32,immvrtxl,LetsNotMeet,INTJ,"Delete or make your social media as private as you can. My life's been a lot better since deleting Facebook and my insta is private. Don't accept anyone you don't know and tbh, if he's making fake accounts on ig, report them all for abuse/harassment. You shouldn't have to live your life afraid of some creep. It scares me that he's so bold with you. It means if he wanted to, he could enact violence against you. Please try and get a restraining order against him when you can. Get authorities involved. I don't want this to end badly and I'm genuinely concerned for you. I would also recommend carrying mace or bear mace with you home from school so that if he assaults you, you have some form of self defence."

I mean, assault on a younger male is still to be expected. John Gacey only attacked males. I'd still watch yourself and maybe take some classes on self defense. A creepy old guy ran at my mother and I when we left a Wendy's asking for change and she told me never talk to people that beg like that. It's from growing up in south Chicago. She took a brick to the eye at a gas station once. I wouldn't put anything passed people."

37,immvrtxl,LetsNotMeet,INTJ,"Big yikes. I really hope he lost his job. That is not okay at all to do, especially in a position of a teacher or authority. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. This is why, as a woman, I tend to trust females over males in authority positions. I hate that it has to be like that but I've had past trauma related to the same and it's unfortunate for good and professional males in those positions."

40,Brainhug,minimalism,INFP,"Way to go :) that can be a difficult but helpful step in removing mental clutter.

Personally, I like to come home and put my phone down in its spot and not pick it up until I leave the house again or unless I get a phone call. I consider social media to be part of my ""socializing"" time during the day and home time to be my ""personal"" time where I can focus on hobbies like painting, exercising, reading or writing. "
41,Brainhug,Meditation,INFP,"Haha! I love that :) 
yet it's the volcanoes that also make new land"
42,Brainhug,minimalism,INFP,"This reminds me of the stoic argument to stop reading new books: https://highexistence.com/stop-reading-new-books-seriously/

TLDR: The time we spend thinking about improving can be better spent on actively improving. 

Personally, I think reflection can help us focus our energies and be more productive as long as we actually follow through on our plans."
43,Brainhug,Stoicism,INFP,"Well said. 

When we say something that is in danger of hurting another person's pride, they are generally more likely to get defensive and become less receptive to what we have to say. 

It is much more productive to find a kind way to say what we want them to know that motivates the person to do better, rather than tears them down and risks them furthering negative thought cycles.


As Stoics, I see it as our goal to release our own pride so that we might better understand the truth in what a person says rather than be harmed by the distasteful or unrefined nature in which they communicate."
44,Brainhug,Meditation,INFP,"I think it's so awesome that you were motivated to meditate entirely from your own experience of consciousness and learned the practices by yourself.

I'm not sure if this is the same, but I often call that scary feeling that emerges ""Holy shit moments"". I think I might have been about the same age as you when I first felt mine, although they first emerged for me from the contemplations of infinite time and present-ness. 

I remember asking a family friend about this feeling and she told me that it was my physical body realizing its own mortality. I'm not sure if that is what it is... although there definitely is a feeling of vulnerability in it. 

It's been a regular practice for me to make as much of my waking and now dreaming life have that ""holy shit"" feel to it. Meditation has helped me achieve that and even increase its strength. It's no longer scary. It makes my senses feel enhanced and time seems to pass differently, although I haven't really noticed something trying to communicate with me as you have. I will try to pay more attention, thanks :)"
45,Brainhug,Buddhism,INFP,"What helps for me is remembering that their beliefs give them great joy and that I do not wish to take that away from them.

 Sometimes I replace the words they use with ones that match my own beliefs (such as 'God' with 'Nature' or 'the unknown'). Looking to the intention of what is being said. If it is compassionate, accepting it with gratitude. If it is not, then releasing it and not letting it take hold. If they choose to get angry and upset with me, then I wish them well and hope their karma does not bring them much suffering. "
46,Brainhug,Stoicism,INFP,"For a modern take, I'm currently reading ""the subtle art of not giving a fuck"" by Mark Manson. It's entertaining and offers a practical definition of happiness that I think merits the attention it received. "
47,Brainhug,Meditation,INFP,This is seriously my favorite show :)
48,Brainhug,Meditation,INFP,Yes :) me too! It's been a great tool for my practice

50,Brainhug,Chakras,INFP,"Keep in mind that the third eye might not open until all the chakras before it are cleared and in balance.

80,Direwolf202,BeAmazed,INTJ,"Normally fluids can be used as an indicator of which way is down. If you tilt a glass of water, the water doesn’t tilt with the glass. However, here, the pilot did a very particular manoeuvre so that there was a centrifugal force that appeared around the same as gravity on the liquid. 

Centrifugal force is an inertial force (it’s not an actual force, but it seems like it is). 

When in a car at a constant speed, you won’t be experienced any force. You are neither accelerating or decelerating in any particular direction. If you go round a corner, however, you will feel a force pushing you opposite to the direction of the turn. This is because your body would, if unimpeded, continue in a straight line. But since you are constrained by the car, you feel a force as if you are being pulled against the turn, while the car counterbalances this. 

The same is happening to the liquid. If the plane disappeared mid turn, leaving just the fluid, it carries on in a straight line. However, the plane is still there, along with the glass. And the pilot has set up his manoeuvre so that the apparent force that the fluid experiences is close to what you experience from gravity. It looks like the liquid isn’t being affected by the turn."

In all seriousness, yes, the drama in this book is so retarded and trivial and just so unrealistic. It makes me wanna slam my head into the wall. 
The Old MC was a goat in personality, confident and witty is used a lot in characters because it simply works. The shy awkward dork character trope is far less used because if done wrong it makes the MC bland and boring and frustrating, all of which describes the new MC. And good god our twin, the fucking twin sibling is such a stupid fucking prick who can be best described as ""Duh, sports, duh, I'm better than you, duh"". Like bitch please. I myself am very athletic in real life and I can't stand her, if you make a jock their character should not 100 percent be centered around that for fucks sake.

His lack of ambition and total denial of and unwillingness to engage with conflict and the fact that I wasn't happy led me to literally being on the brink of leaving him. We were fighting every day, desperately unhappy.  

When he thought I was leaving him, he cried the first tears I'd ever seen from him-- in over a decade. It was a real wake up call for him. He began to consider his own actions and how terribly uninvolved he had been in my life. 

We've worked hard on our relationship and have gotten things to a better place, but we have kids and so lots of reasons to stay together.

Since you’re either IxTP or IxTJ, this means you are either a Ti dominant, Si, or Ni.

But I am going with IxTJ because I don’t see any indication of Ne which could make you appear as scatterbrained or hyper in your thinking. 

Now I am down with either ISTJ or INTJ. You have a lot of Te in you first off. You are someone who prefers an efficient and more organized  approach. 

However, after reading your answer to whenever you daydream or attached to reality. It literally screams Ni to me. So therefore, my answer will be you are an INTJ.

If you are confused or concerned about something, you can ask right away!"

>I just want to be happy, have fulfilling and loving relationships, be able to show the real ""naked"" me to the people I care about and them accepting me the way I am, I accepting them for who they are, even if it would be hard. I just want authenticity and mutual love and respect. Professionally, I want to earn enough to help support my loved ones, while also help people through work, whether it may be in a non-profit, consulting, government etc.

*That's the most Fi thing I ever heard it's not even funny..* You value authenticity and individuality. Fi doms are all about knowing their personal values. They are also the ones to usually help those they feel are undeserved in any way. Fi types may not be the best at expressing, but they find many ways to do it such as drawing, sports, dancing, creating, etc. 

>I like writing for self-expression, liberation of thoughts.  
I love movies just for the art of cinema, the characters, their stories, lives, love, adventure, lessons, All of it intrigues me,  
I enjoy going for walks and to the gym simply for the alone time, some thinking time, freedom from the day. 

More Fi 👀

>It's only important if expectations aren't being met, I guess. I do have trouble being efficient though.

Inferior Te. You show it when you 500% have to or is under stress. Expectations that aren't being met would stress out most people, but for Fi doms they would use Te for the sake of being efficient when there's no other choice.

I am going to say ISFP! I say this because you are a lot more physical oriented (Gym and other physical activities). I do notice more Se than Ne from you. I do take it you like to do activities that requires physical effort (correct me if I am wrong though lmao).

Other games from the same genre for low-end includes: 
- Titan Quest (get both Immortal Throne + Ragnarok to be good, a bit pricey for what it offers imo)
- Dungeon Siege 2 (runs terribly on win 8 + 10, need lots of tweak to work properly on those 2)

Extroverted Intuition (Ne) - Pursuing possibilities that may or may not act on, new ideas and concepts, drawn to theory, innovative and creative/original, idea/theory in breadith

Introverted Intuition (Ni) - Focusing on the meaning, trusting the unconscious information, conclusions come out of nowhere, idea/theory in depth

**Judging**

Extroverted Thinking (Te) - Organizing the outer world, thinking out loud, directing people, efficiency of the systems

Introverted Thinking (Ti) - Thinking inwardly, taking apart systems to analyze in depth, logical decisions

Extroverted Feeling (Fe) - Seeking outer harmony, dislikes conflict, evaluating others' feelings

Introverted Feeling (Fi) - Doing what you want for personal happiness, controlling and engaging with inner emotions

Now find the description you fit the most. This is your dominant function. Then here are some rules to choose your secondary function:

1- The identity (Introverted/Extroverted) must be reversed on the secondary function.

2- The role (Perceiving/Judging) must be different on the secondary function.

This creates 16 types and their most prefered function pairs. The first one is the dominant, the second one is the secondary/supporter/auxiliary.

308,black_gravity27,gaymers,ISTP,"I was never religious to begin with, even among a family of Christians and before realizing I am homosexual. I could only believe what I see in front of me, with my senses. Everything else were just questions I didn't really care to have answers for and skepticism (mainly for what made no sense). Then fully accepting undeniable truths, such as my sexual orientation, and not hiding that truth from family (especially extended, as they learned, mainly through adding me on Facebook) no matter the consequences.

Any strength I needed I found on my own, and through myself. To grow and evolve into who I am today, and to keep improving myself.

That all happened a decade ago. Feels like a long time since.

350,throwaway3n1p,Enneagram,ESTP,"It is indeed interesting how it is linked to your behaviour, but it is not so if we start to determine enneagram through behaviour. I've looked through many forums about mistypes and apparently it starts from identifying their type through behaviour instead of the _motivation_ behind the behaviour.

A 7 may fear Alzheimers because it interferes with their pursuit of new experiences while a 5 may fear it  because of how it prevents them from using their knowledge, for example. "

356,throwaway3n1p,MbtiTypeMe,ESTP,"What if he was replying to a comment that was replying to a post? When you press on the post yourself it's probably better formatted anyway. Also, OP mostly replies to type me posts, and he will have to copy and paste some large chunks and it's tougher for you to scroll down **and** find what actually was commented by OP which will be worse if he doesn't bold some sentences. OP may also think that his history presents his authentic self instead of those questions because he may not be self-aware.

Looking through his comment section is pretty much the same as reading through a chunk of answers to the megathread questions. I think that OP is actually making it easier for you since his thought process and preferences are easily shown through what he does in his history rather than some carefully chosen answers that may or may not show biasedness.

>MAKE you do the whole thing.

If someone's type me post provides less information than OP's history, it's even worse than what you suggested. Over here it's quality over quantity.

I get what you mean, and I'm just trying to say that sometimes the history says much more about a person than their selected information about themselves. Take type me threads as interviews and their history as their informal self. Which do you think portray themselves better? "

374,Cutezacoatl,AskReddit,ENTJ,"Former sex worker here, I fell in love with a client. He looked kind of rockabilly, and had heaps of tattoos, he'd bring me coffee and we'd talk about books and music. He made me a playlist of his favourite songs, and brought me a copy of his favourite book. We swapped real names and talked honestly about life and relationships. One night we met up in a bar and he hung out with my friends, stayed out all night and he crashed at mine. We were together for about two years. I quit sex work and went back to university, got a normal job. We moved in together, my family adored him and I got along really well with his mother. 

We broke up for pretty normal reasons, I wanted a responsible partner who I could build a life with, save money, be fit and healthy. He wanted to tour with the band, drink and party. Last time I saw him he was in and out of rehab and in some volatile relationship. I saw his mother last year and his business had failed, he hadn't been sticking with rehab and he was being charged with assaulting his ex-girlfriend. I really hope he manages to deal with his problems and get clean, I'm still thankful for the time we had and don't hold any grudges.

The fact that he keeps making the same mistakes shows he’s willing to hurt other people in his attempt to avoid his real problems."
397,takkenne,SkincareAddiction,ENFJ,"I agree sooooo hard. My husband didn’t know you were supposed to wash your face twice a day, and when he does, he can’t figure out which bottle to use. “The cleanser.” “Which one is the cleanser??” And then he’s like “Do I use water first? How long do I rub it in?” and I’m just wondering why the eff it’s so confusing for him. To me, it’s OBVIOUS; I’ve been working on my skincare since I was 12. He had bad acne his entire teen years and no one told him facewash made a difference, let alone everything else available. 

For some reason, male hygiene is so low on the list in society. Yeah, my husband is dense, but I feel like it still should have been taught to him. Totally agree!! I hope male skincare becomes normalized!"
398,takkenne,vaginismus,ENFJ,"1: We’re soooo open and honest. If something doesn’t work for me, I say it lol. We’ve explored a lot of different kinks and had a lot of different types of sex. 

2: We’ve incorporated toys. Idk how I survived without vibrators lol. Literally don’t know. They’ve helped me want to have sex sooooo much more! They make things mutually enjoyable, which is great cuz it’s hard to get me to orgasm.

3: I made sex a priority. I’m the “low desire partner” and only want sex once a week/once a month if left to my own devices. Sex is how my husband says I love you tho so going without it was very damaging to our relationship. I just made the commitment (without being pressured) to try to have sex once a day. I get to pick when I initiate, and if there’s a time when I’m like, “You know, I could have sex rn.” then I go for it. 

4: We didn’t wait for my vaginismus to be cured to start. The foundation we laid while I had vaginismus is what allows us to have great sex today."
399,takkenne,SkincareAddiction,ENFJ,"One tip: I have recently had EXTREMELY dry skin, and I was layering a ton of moisturizers and it didn’t matter lol. A few hours later, my skin would be dry again, and by the end of the day, I was flaky and tight.

What FINALLY worked for me: all of your products are amazing, but if you want to improve longevity, consider adding an oil to your routine. Dry skin lacks oil, which causes moisture from your products to evaporate through the day potentially. Patting in 2-4 drops of oil on top of your products as a last step could get rid of any remaining tightness or flakes you might be experiencing. I use Physician’s Formula Bright Booster oil. It’s organic, has AMAZING oils in it, it won’t clog pores, and it’s saved my skin. It completely absorbs into your skin after 30 min to an hour. It also makes my makeup go on beautifully."
400,takkenne,vaginismus,ENFJ,"She has vaginismus. If she dilated every day for a few weeks, she’d probably progress to being able to have sex. But I’m sorry that she has no interest in any type of sex—sex is important for the intimacy and health of a relationship. My husband and I have similar backgrounds to you and your wife, but we have sex 1-3 times a week even if we don’t have penetration. 

Your wife seems to have more issues than just vaginismus. I think you guys might benefit from a sex therapist. If she has no sex drive, there’s gotta be something you guys can do, a way she can enjoy sex. Has she orgasmed before?

Marriages can’t survive with zero intimacy. She should be taking your needs into consideration if you’re taking hers into consideration."
401,takkenne,vaginismus,ENFJ,"You have vaginismus. Your boyfriend’s an idiot—he thinks a diagnosis will make it more real and will make the problem worse. He thinks denial is going to cure a condition that requires empathy, patience, and hard work to cure. Ha. I WISH denial and “just relaxing” fixed it lol. 

He’s not ready to face what’s going on, but you guys are already living with it. Accepting you have vaginismus is step 1 to curing it. Saying it doesn’t exist only prolongs the process."
402,takkenne,vaginismus,ENFJ,"Hey, for what it’s worth, your reaction is totally and completely valid no matter what. I had no sexual trauma—I was just terrified of my vagina (and my butthole...and my belly button... lol). When my high school bf tried to grab me down there THROUGH JEANS I about had a panic attack and cried whenever I thought about it. 

I flinched when people went near my vagina—doctors, my fiance (now husband). I wanted sex but I was TERRIFIED of down there. It was scary and disgusted me and I hated it. I couldn’t even FIND my vagina. 

It turned out I needed a hymenectomy, then I had to spend some time just looking at my vagina to desensitize myself because I thought they were so ugly. I tried to “explore” but it was so disgusting to me to touch the area (even tho I would masturbate through clothes). I’d feel intense panic and struggle not to cry. I was married and I couldn’t touch my own vagina lol.

Dilating helped me take control of my vagina and that part of my life. At first, I was so so so scared. But I wanted to be better. If dilators (Or in this case tampons) scare you, then take tiny baby steps. Your first “dilating” session could be pressing the dilator against your inner thigh. Then your vulva. Then near your entrance. Then in it. You could stretch this over weeks, never going further unless you felt you could. If you feel the anxiety, stop. Just keep it right where it is. Get used to it, till something on your inner thigh isn’t a big deal, till it’s not a big deal against your vulva, till it’s not a big deal near your entrance, till it’s not a big deal to penetrate.

Once I could consistently get a dilator in, some of my panic subsided. And once I was able to go up in sizes consistently, my anxiety evaporated. I knew this part of my body. I understood it. I knew exactly where it was, how to get inside it, and how everything would feel. I could do it in different positions. I could do it whenever I felt like it. I had regained control over my body.

I have no experience with sexual trauma but I’d say don’t sell yourself short and trust your feelings, period, because it’s not exactly a typical thing to imagine it’s happened to you and to be wrong. And I say take your time and go so slow. If you want to do this, you CAN do this. It might help to visit with a therapist. But I hope my experience might help a little, even if it’s not quite the same."
403,takkenne,vaginismus,ENFJ,"No! Definitely not! Your pelvic floor muscles *have* to tighten in order to orgasm! It’s a good thing—the one positive experience you might have with your vagina that day. Keep it up!

I’ve noticed that when I imagine penetration and get grossed out, my muscles clench, and *that* is bad for vaginismus. I need to have positive thoughts and I need to consciously relax my vagina throughout the day."
404,takkenne,vaginismus,ENFJ,"I was like this, and I ended up having vaginismus but that doesn’t mean you will. I was like “Nope. It’s just wrong. Things don’t go in there.” This made putting in a tampon go horrifically wrong—sweating, crying, panicked because I couldn’t “find the hole.”

I ignored it for years. High school boyfriend tried to go down on me but I felt too panicked and started crying for no apparent reason. It turns out I had a hymen problem (which is why I couldn’t find the hole, and I had to get surgery) but that’s not what caused my weird phobia of penetration. My phobia seems to have caused my vaginismus, so when I finally got to penetration after my surgery, it hurt pretty bad. Hopefully that’s not the case for you. 

What helped me get past it (as I now can have sex): I spent time just looking at my vagina with a mirror. It stopped grossing me out after doing this a lot; it’s just a vagina. Neutral. Then I laid my hand on my bare vagina/vulva/whatever which I always avoided doing—and it felt *so wrong* but I kept it there for 60 second intervals. Soon it felt clinical, not a big deal. Then I dilated for the first time when I got my kit, and that was a huge deal. It was so hard the first few times (like, what if I can’t find the hole? What if it doesn’t go in?) but after 5-10 times, it felt normal, natural. Soon it was normal and I felt like I had control of the situation, and I was able to get through dilators and have sex. I’m not 100% there with my vagina—I don’t like fingering myself for instance—but I‘m totally fine with a penis and tampons and that’s all I want lol."
405,takkenne,vaginismus,ENFJ,"What cbd oil did you use, and how did you use it??"
406,takkenne,vaginismus,ENFJ,"I’d be extremely upset. This whole thing gets me fired up. I’m cured now, and I just think guys who whine about their partners having vaginismus are being so narrow minded and selfish. How would they feel if sex felt like their skin was being ripped off their penis each and every thrust? How would they feel if sex, even without vaginismus, felt pretty mediocre? Vaginas have the same amount of nerve endings as the back of your hand. So imagine rubbing the back of your hand really fast and that’s what penetration feels like. Wow, AMAZING... 

Guys get this mindblowing incredible experience with penetration, but 30% of women experience pain during sex. And yet men feel entitled when this isn’t handed to them on a silver platter?

You’re a woman who loves him. You’re so so so much more than your capacity to have ONE type of sex. Don’t let him forget that. And don’t let vaginismus keep you guys from exploring and getting creative. We still do stuff we discovered because penetration wasn’t an option, and it’s been amazing even now that we can do penetration."

> **By ALL accounts, *Rhodes did not* inflict any of the mortal wounds upon any of the victims**—a mitigating circumstance. He did provide the weapons, the gloves and the transportation, with full knowledge of **what *Steven Woods* planned.**

Reddit has good intentions, but both sides of the story have to be heard.

**EDIT:** 

A lot of people keep referring me to Steven's account. Let me ask you this: If (as Steven claims) Marcus Rhodes was really the only one that killed these people, then what was his motive?

The websites above state that Steven had a motive: to kill a drug dealing rival.

Another point: Beth was killed because she witnessed the murder. If Steven truly had no part in the killing (and was as 'shocked' in the car as he says he was), why did Marcus not kill him, too, for being another supposed witness?

One key point is: **Steven ran to a different state (California) after the murders. If you were truly an innocent bystander to a murder (as he claims), why would you run?** Why not report it and immediately exonerate yourself, rather than run and risk blame?"

524,ExcellentNothing,AskReddit,INFP,"You can't just diagnose people who do things that are unusual as autistic. It does a disservice to autistic people and is also just ignorant.

525,ExcellentNothing,relationships,INFP,"Divorce would be an overreaction. It's good you took some space for yourself to think.

Sex and love are different things. I know you are upset, but at the end of the day, you are the one she chose to marry out of love, and that is much more meaningful than superficial sex talk.

Also we can't control our sexual fantasies; she didn't do it to hurt you. It's just an awkward truth that has no bearing on how much she loves you."

I was just sharing the possibilities that not all autistic people are Sheldon Cooper control-freak stereotypes that ""need help"", so the fact that you can't grasp that logic and are extrapolating straw man arguments is also pretty ignorant. 

Oftentimes a control freak is just a fucking neurotypical control freak, can we just leave the diagnoses to the professionals? 

Honestly I'm just tired of armchair psychologists immediately diagnosing anyone who falls outside of social norms as autistic. It's become a catchall for undesirable social stupidity instead of a legitimate and highly specific cluster of traits. Unless you are a practicing mental healthcare professional and they're your patient, you shouldn't be making these calls, period, and doing so is pure ignorance, especially when you're talking about abusers and other criminals.

After that there will be a very long wait (mine was about a year and a half but now I have had a few appointments and it goes quite quick) and then there is an assessment period of 6 ish meetings to determine what he wants to do and if anything else needs to be put in place and this will probably take 6 months or a bit longer. Then I'm pretty sure that if wanted you can get referred from gids to a gids endocrinologist and they sort out hormone blockers and hormone replacement therapy (testosterone) which I don't think takes very long (I haven't got to this point so I'm not really sure but from my understanding this is what happens). You have to be on hormone blockers for a year before you can get hrt and you also have ot be 16.

540,Giovana_P,Enneagram,INTP,"For me you seem a lot like a 7. You have way more reasons on 7 then in 9. 

About why you think you may not be a 7, it sounds a lot like 7's virtue, sobriety, when you're mostly satisfied with your life but can still perceive and accept the negative experiences as an important part of it. And your strong mind probably comes from your 8 wing

I actually didn't understand what you said about having something wrong in your mind, but I don't think I'd have much to add on that anyway.

545,Giovana_P,Enneagram,INTP,"Yeah, I've been trying to do that, but I found out it's harder that it seems. Also, most of the material on enneagram that you get on internet only looks very superficiously (is this word right?) Into those.

Anyway, I suppose one of my biggest fears is to finish an ""unfulfilled"" life, and unhappy with what I've done with my time. I guess this ressembles more the seven's fear, deprivation, but I'm not sure, because I don't totally understand the meaning that ""deprivation"" has in this case."

Now, if what you say is right, that's a small indication that I may be a nine. Of course, given my confusion, I could also be haf the enneagram"
549,Giovana_P,fairytail,INTP,"I honestly didn't think END would be back, but I'm rethinking it, since Natsu looks exactly like that time he fought Gay in Alvarez arc. However, when Lucy rewrited END's book she said something like ""the Natsu we know is no demon"", which seems to mean that she erased the demon part of him. So now I really don't know what is coming, and I'm exited.

About Lucy saying she was afraid of Natsu's flames, she may be right, since those flames came from Ignia, who doesn't seem to mean any good. And, of course, there's the odd possibility of END. Other than that, I think there's no need for her to worry about him, since violent and lacking control is just the way Natsu always fights."

551,themanofmanyways,AskReddit,INTJ,"This is a cultural thing I guess. I'm Yoruba and the only reason I could possibly throw my grand mother out of the house is if living with her is an absolute nightmare. Even if my grandmother had a billion dollar life insurance policy and planned on leaving nothing for me after dying, I wouldn't kick her out of my house or even see that as a reasonable option (I mean, to be honest if I was in dire need for cash and she pulled that, I would be pissed, and the idea would certainly flash through my head more than once, but I wouldn't go through with it or even think it reasonable).

It's less of an ""offence"" and more of, should I say, a ""withholding"" of what most people should give. And while that's a shame, if you aren't taking care of someone to get something then while you might feel hurt (which is perfectly understandable), you shouldn't react that way."

553,themanofmanyways,literature,INTJ,"*The Decameron* by Giovanni Boccaccio.

The stories of first day to the third or so were nice and engaging, and they do a good job of putting the reader in the atmosphere of the Middle Ages. Those of the fourth and some of the fifth, however, were somewhat painful to read. I say painful because while I'm sure the stories were particularly engaging when they were written, the romanticizing of cheating in the name of love put me off immensely. I was practically waiting for the fourth day to end. I think I can understand why affairs are glamorized, however. Unless I'm mistaken, taken from what the book has said so far as well as prior knowledge, arranged marriages were the norm (especially in the upper classes) in those days. Marriages born out of love were a lot rarer than today. Compounding this was the social requirement of marrying a partner befitting one's class. Finally is how women seemed to have little say in who they married. This is just my guess using the little I've picked up from the book as well as general knowledge I'm not sure how I know (it could be TV and a bit of other things I've read for all I know)

Considering how the book is written for women, I suppose it makes a lot of sense that while one can find many instances of women cheating on their husbands, instances of husbands cheating on their wives are nonexistent. At least, so far. Still, I'm only on the sixth day. Let's see what the rest of the story holds."

It's definitely not light in tone like ISSTH or AWE but rather takes place in a grittier, darker cultivation world. It's much closer to Pursuit of the Truth/Beseech the Devil. I found it a little slow in the beginning, but it eventually blows up to become epic from chapter to chapter. Frankly, I think out of all of Er Gen's MCs, Wang Lin (i.e. RI's MC) most deserves the title of heaven defying cultivator."

>But if all you're reading is easily digested fiction (which I'm not disdaining — I read genre fiction too on a regular basis), then you really don't have much to congratulate yourself about over someone who just watches films and TV.

660,chanuliw,LoveIslandTV,INFP,"I think most people can understand Amy's emotions. The reason why she's getting so much flak is because of the way she's treating Lucie. It's fine to be insecure, but the problem is that she's resorting to what is arguably bullying to feel more secure when she could be going about it in so many other ways. 

Insecurity is something to be worked on. It's not an excuse for shitty actions"

I'm surprised to hear that other people have been drawing the same comparisons. I think most reality TV shows can be seen as similar to THG, but LI is more similar in that both shows are GIGANTIC in their respective countries.

Amber reminds me of Katniss in the way they both received so much unexpected support and love from the public, but the books mentioned that the public started wearing their hair in Katniss's braid after she won, and it kinda makes me wonder if Molly Mae's bun would've caught on with the public had she won lol"

664,chanuliw,LoveIslandTV,INFP,Yeah... can't imagine how difficult it must've been for her
665,chanuliw,AmItheAsshole,INFP,"NAH. I think you have good intentions, and I understand why you want to have 1 on 1 time with your son. 

Your daughter's young, however, and judging by the fact by what your wife said, it sounds like your daughter feels hurt by your actions and told your mother so. I think most children at this age would feel upset if their father did something like that, and I wouldn't be surprised if she feels or grows up to feel as if you favour her brother. You should try putting away a little more time for just her, imo; I know your family plays games together  frequently, but having 1 on 1 time on the PS4 with your daughter *as well* as with your son may make her feel less excluded, whilst still providing your son with the 1 on 1 time he needs."

Someone will put both the dogs outside, and some time later she is inside with no one admitting to having let her in.  Sometimes she'll be outside when no one has let her out.  We have two dogs, and every single time this happens, she'll be alone with the other one outside/inside - and they're normally let out/in together.  No dog doors and we don't leave the doors open without the screens shut.

I don't really think she's teleporting (I hope she's not, the ramifications are terrifying), but I seriously have no rational explanation for it unless someone in the house is developing dementia or amnesia and doesn't like the other dog."

742,BendiganYT,darksouls,INFJ,"Not all humans are victims of the undead curse; there are other kingdoms outside of Lordran where being undead is stigmatized and being fully human is normal. Those without the curse die normally and leave a body behind. That's one theory that explains the bodies. 

Another theory is that when an undead dies, their corpse remains there until they respawn at the last bonfire. While this is highly unlikely, it's still technically possible.

There is a third possibility, though, and it's a much darker one. You know those hollows in that first area of the New Londo Ruins? They're not aggressive, they're sad and afraid. They're also *stationary, never moving even if you hit them*. So it could be that all the ""corpses"" around Lordran are actually hollows that have *completely* broken, so disheartened and miserable and numb that they simply lie there, unmoving, forever. It's the next step after becoming similar to the New Londo hollows. They just don't--or can't--care enough to stop you when you take items off them, so we assume they're corpses and treat them as such. When you think of them that way, the game changes quite a bit, doesn't it?

765,Hiromant,MGTOW,INTJ,"My problem with TRP is, they are all about effort. It's ultimately a list of all the things you need to do to hopefully qualify for female attention. It's no different than the blue pill apart from the items on the list.

It's also a coping mechanism for physically unattractive guys who hope they can lift, work, lie and posture their way into what comes effortlessly for tall, good looking, confident men.

MGTOW is ironically also the optimal ideology for attracting women. Fuck effort, don't give a shit about them. Direct your energy toward obtaining the life you want to live. If any of them like you, your indifference will only make them work harder for your attention. If not, there's not much you could have done about it anyway."

785,an-estj,Enneagram,ESTJ,"For enneagram, the way I see it is looking for the sun that their behavior revolves around. 

For example, I was in school with a 3w4 that I didn’t like too much. He was pretty highly regarded among most of our peers, but spent an awful lot of time behaving like he was trying to prove something to me or get me to admit his superiority in some area. As someone who generally doesn’t give a shit if people like them or care about proving myself to someone that clearly doesn’t want to be around me, my brain flagged this behavior. And when I looked a little deeper (starting paying attention to the language he used with others, the way he would talk about certain things he was good at, how he reacted to praise etc etc), the 3 was the obvious sun that he revolved around. 

In regards to narrowing, I’d say I rarely immediately know someone’s full type and enneagram right off the bat. I personally think many enneagrams look similar (3w4 versus 4w3, etc) so generally I narrow it as “they’re either this or that” and pay a little closer attention to ultimately identify their core need. 

As a last side note, I’d say that enneagram (at least to me) feels incomplete without doing the MBTI typing alongside it or before. I think they work best supplementally and fill in each other’s gaps."

866,deepBlueCheese,Christian,INTJ,"Scripture seems to have pretty high standards for itself in terms of communicating a lot of content with great brevity.

However, there are a few proverbs which I think are funny in a dry kind of way

""Let your foot be rarely in your neighbor's house, lest he become weary of you and hate you'"" Prov 25:17

Or

 “Bad, bad,” says the buyer, but when he goes away, then he boasts."" Prov 20:14"
867,deepBlueCheese,Christianity,INTJ,"Good question!

The term actually has different meanings in different places.

In Israel, most believers would call themselves Messianic rather than Christian, as the term is much less loaded with potential negative connotation. This is quite a fair thing to do, esp. as 'Christ' comes from the Greek translation of the word Messiah.

In America there is a strong Messianic movement which is essentially a group of people moving back to the Jewish roots of the faith.

The range here is quite significant. Some people enjoy the odd Jewish feast for fun, and like to learn more about the Old Testament, etc.

On the other hand, you can get people doing things like: calling themselves Jews when they aren't biologically, moving back into legalism, or having a significant superiority complex. There can sometimes be a very painful culture of people being almost bizarrely attached to the minutia of Jewish tradition, even more so than Messianic believers in Israel.

Outside of the States this range exists as well, although there's probably a lower concentration of what you might call 'hard-core' Messianic culture.

Having had a little bit to do with different people in these ranges, I think there's a lot to gain from the understandings of people in the Messianic movement, but also a fair bit of peril in sacrificing the Centrality of Christ on the altar of Jewishness."

I've been there. I think pretty much every male has.
I think God uses weaknesses like this in our lives to help us depend on His strength, which isn't something we do by default! Our natural response to our own failures is to just try and come up with clever techniques from our own strength to try harder.
Paul talks about this problem in Romans.

Romans 7:18-19 says:
18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. 19 For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. 

I would really highly recommend that you do a really decent Bible study into Romans to look at this. One great book to explain this topic is called ""Lifetime Guarantee"" by a guy called Bill Gillham.

How does it do that? Unlike bacteria, it has no organelles, or any means of obtaining resources or energy to both create new virus babies. 

A virus (bacteriophage, in this example) will use its attachment 'legs' to grab a bacteria, lower its 'head' into it, and inject its DNA (or RNA) into the bacterial host, where the virus USES the metabolic processes of the bacterial host as well as the DNA/RNA replication, protein synthesis factories to create hundreds of new baby viruses inside the bacterial host. 

After some time, or after a given termination point, the bacterial host basically explodes and releases more viruses that go on to affect other bacteria/hosts.

Imagine a fly that can burrow into your heart, drinks your blood and stores a ton of baby flies that are created using your own bodily proteins and resources and explodes out of your chest killing you, and releasing hundreds of baby flies that look for other people.

Furthermore, her death is important in shaping the story and made Code Geass so powerful in its themes. Lelouch learning that there are consequences for his actions, becoming more determined nonetheless, his turn to Zero Requiem--her death was influential factor in it all.

943,Clarkeste,MarioMaker,INFP,"The reason people don't like NSMBU is, in my opinion:1: Lifeless.

So, it must mean features is not why NSMBU is disliked, right?

Boos and likes are relative to one another.

So, at 3000 maker points, (supposedly) a Boo is 37 maker points, and a like is 15 maker points or something. So, it stands to theory, that perhaps that declining ratio impacted the large change each stage is deleted."

950,Clarkeste,MarioMaker2,INFP,"The designers did think of this. There is a reason they didn't go with it.

1: Lots of stages in that tab would be impossible

2: Impossible stages would lower player morale, and make them want to go else where

3: Good stage creators play every section of their stage dozens of times before upload. They wanted to make you playtest at least once.

4:  If a creator does not playtest their stage, it's possible that (unintentionally) the stage really is impossible. Your entire description here makes me think you don't playtest actively, which leads me to believe some of your stages, in reality, may be unbeatable, and possibly even unpolished. You can't just force half of the making duty onto someone else.

5: ""Nintendo is stealing form you?"" I'm not sure if I was supposed to, but I find this a little bit funny. It's not Nintendo fault that you play kaizo badly. I don't want to be rude, but that's the truth here, you're making stages that are waaay harder than your skill level, then blaming Nintendo when you can't beat them.

6: You payed 100$ dollars for the game? Did it go out of sale at your shop or something?

7: (not exact quote) ""I feel like Nintendo is stealing the core game from me (level creation and upload)""
There are so many things wrong with  this sentence. First of all, they're not stealing anything. Not everyone can have the same skill as big time streamers. If anything, your skill stole it away from you—and I get it! I also suck at kaizo and can't upload kaizo. That's not Nintendo's fault, though. That's because I suck at the game. 
How are they stealing level creation? You can still make the levels, can't you? 
The core game is subjective for everyone."

In no particular order.

* Reddit is Lust, a highly addictive and indulgent platform that tempts users with knowledge and ruins their lives with memes.
* TVTropes is Sloth, due to its uncanny ability to drain one's time.
* Snapchat is Pride, due to the frivolous self-indulgence it represents by its very existence.
* Instagram is Envy, due to the vanity and vote obsession it creates, often breeding rivals from friends.
* Facebook is Wrath, a volatile platform that stands both as a useful tool for expression and a means of aggressive self-destruction.
* Buzzfeed is Greed, a modern sensationalist news platform that profits off of misinforming and wasting the time of the lowest common denominator.
* 4chan is Gluttony, a growling beast that devours all mercy and innocence that dare approach it."
1013,Oudynfury,Fantasy,INFP,"Dune might well be my favourite book of all time; it's certainly one of them, at least. The level of thematic and philosophical depth contained within the story is honestly mind-boggling and the world-building is second to none. While it's not without its flaws, the lack of relatable characters and stilted dialogue coming to mind, Dune is undeniably a masterwork of literature.

The sequels are excellent too, in a slightly different way. Dune itself is an incredible stand-alone, and perhaps the best story in the series, but the sequels through God-Emperor at least expand on its philosophical depth to an enormous degree. I would recommend them to any reader of the first book who wants to see the story continued or its ideas expanded upon, but would caution that they often completely lack the human element that Dune is already kind of shaky with.

So, yeah. Incredible book, and equally incredible philosophical dissertation. Dune isn't just a novel; it's a feat of storytelling and deserves to be recorded as not just a classic of the genre but a classic of literature, period."

After doing so, I came to the conclusion that you're completely correct. It's utter nonsense, intended to make him seem intelligent when he really, really isn't. 

In my experience, highly intelligent people spend less time asserting their intelligence (unless they're very insecure) and more time trying to teach and learn from other people. They recognize that while they are smart, there are people who are smarter, and even those far less intelligent than them can still teach them things. This guy does not. Instead, he boasts about how much better he is than everyone else in the most pathetic, validation-seeking manner he can."
1021,Oudynfury,wow,INFP,"Having played both WoW and GW2 (albeit the latter in mostly PvP), I agree wholeheartedly. The games are built around fundamentally different philosophies. Guild Wars 2 characters have infinitely more tools available to them than WoW characters when it comes to avoiding, ignoring and cheesing mechanics. GW2 also allows players to be a lot more self sufficient; in WoW, players are dependent upon each other for survival while in GW2, the action combat and self-healing systems allow players to take care of themselves in many circumstances.

Another critical point is that of the downed state; in GW2, players don't immediately die upon reaching zero hit points and in fact cannot be instantly killed by any source whatsoever (though there may be some boss mechanics that subvert this). While brilliant design from a PvP perspective, the existence of the downed state makes failure a lot more forgiving. Rather than a limited number of combat resurrections spread across a large group, GW2 allows for liberal combat rezzes in most situations.

When it comes down to it, WoW is more forceful and less forgiving when it comes to encounter and character design. WoW players have a consistent and limited set of resources available to them in any given situation, and bosses are designed around this fact. Not just limited on a per-player basis but on a raid-wide one. Take Bloodlust, for example, a buff given out by Shamans (well, and some others). It's extremely powerful, but when received, it puts a debuff on players that prevents them from receiving Bloodlust again for a period that is far longer than the duration of the spell. Take all the Shamans you like, you're not getting more Bloodlust.

Blizzard understands exactly what your characters are capable of doing, and because of the way WoW works, you're playing on their terms. If they want a mechanic to be impossible to ignore, it will be, because no well-timed dodge can save you from a nuclear explosion. Well, maybe if you're a rogue with Cloak of Shadows, but you can't build a raid out of rogues. If a boss requires a tank-swap because of a stacking bleed, that bleed will be incurable. WoW is designed around rigid, hard-set rules. They can be mitigated at times and broken in very specific situations, but they aren't ""soft"" rules like GW2's.

Don't get me wrong, I love GW2. But it's a different game, a more forgiving game. It's a game that gives players agency, allows for significant errors. and presents problems that have more than one solution.

/u/GW2Bergal, [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tbf87mPWuA) are [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38U4RAxhCTE) boss guides that in my mind, exemplify high-end WoW raiding. The first is Mythic Kil'Jaeden, undoubtedly the hardest and least forgiving boss in the current expansion. The second is Heroic Siegecrafter Blackfuse, a boss from two expansions ago who nonetheless demonstrates the extreme degree of mechanical complexity to some WoW bosses. I think these bosses highlight just how important the mechanics are to WoW raid bosses, and how strict they can often be."
1022,Oudynfury,worldbuilding,INFP,"Attempting to usurp the Dreamer, the local creator goddess. It's entirely possible; in fact, Alivus II succeeded in doing so. The ritual isn't even that hard, if you can get your hands on her body and have access to several hundred experienced spellcasters. It's not really a good idea, though. The Dreamer is totally detached from the suffering of humanity; in fact, she'd probably rather us rot away to nothing than anything else. And that's a good thing.

Let's just say there's a reason that the Blood Gods of old forced the Dreamer into a sleeping state, where she can only muster occasional semi-conscious actions. The Dreamer has all the powers of infinity, but none of the omniscience necessary to use it. Because of this, her attempts to create perfection will inevitably fail. So what's the point I'm getting at? As Alivus II found out rather harshly, no mind is capable of comprehending infinity. It doesn't matter what your intentions are; attempting to wield the power of creation will result in catastrophe as you unknowingly break the laws of the universe.

So, yeah. You can absolutely become God. Unfortunately, not even God is smart enough to *be* God, so what makes you think you are? Unless you want to sleep forever, knowing that your dreams and desires will subtly reshape the world around you, but you can never awake to direct them, I do not recommend it. You could become the Devourer instead, and be able to destroy anything. That's a limited infinity, so humans can understand it. Unfortunately, you will be totally isolated, unable to even *speak* properly, left to act as your race's silent and despised protector, just as the Devourer does now. So altogether, becoming a Cosmic Twin? Not recommended. "

1052,Beanbean5916,AskReddit,ENFP,I think it would be a very good idea
1053,Beanbean5916,AskReddit,ENFP,"I've dealt with this a lot over the past year, and I have found a few tools that have greatly benefitted me.   
One is simply using your natural voice. Often, when anxious or pretending, we subconsciously change our voice to fit our facade. Simply focusing on using our natural tone of voice can help us feel more relaxed, independent, and more ourselves.  
The next one is similar. Only act as energetic as you *are*. You DO NOT have to pretend to be excited about everything. You DO NOT have to smile and laugh all the time. Nobody does that naturally. Sometimes I think we mistake the absence of a positive reaction for a sign of inner weakness and turmoil, so we quickly cover it up with a laugh and a smile, and this quickly can become toxic, as maintaining it can be an immense drain on our well being and stamina. To instead focus on reacting naturally and only acting as energetic as we feel, we can regain a lot of confidence, because we can own what's real, not something made up that could crack any second.  
This leads to the final and most important thing, *own the things that make you* ***you.*** As I have observed people, I have noticed the thing that sets apart those who are not themselves and those who are is the fact that they own their qualities, and not in a cheesy, love yourself even if you're awful kind of way. You have to be comfortable enough with who you are to make fun of yourself and laugh the hardest out of all of them. This doesn't mean you have to like everything about yourself, that would be incredibly vain and unhealthy. We all have flaws, and it is healthy to want to solve our issues. But it is important to remember that EVERYONE is dealing with the same stuff. It's nothing new, nothing more horrendous, nothing less solvable than things others have gone through and conquered before you. Once you realize this, it can help to make your tasks a little less daunting, and a little more tame and normal, even funny!

Finally finally finally, accept that you will not be able to do any of this sometimes. There will be times when your brain just won't have any of it. That is the time to cool down, take a break, refresh, and wait for your feelings to pass. The most important thing is to not be mad at yourself for your feelings, let them come and go, and deal with them accordingly when you can. 

You are a beautiful human soul out there in the universe somewhere, and I believe you can do this. Everyone can."
1054,Zoogoalkeeper,juul,ENFJ,"I'm a nicotine hater.
But I think these cases are connected by counterfeit toxic THC cartridges."
1055,Zoogoalkeeper,juul,ENFJ,"This is what happenes with any drug that works on the reward system.
You are getting your dopamine receptors saturated by the constant hits.
So the brain,in order to adjust will regulate by controlling or even stop the dopamine factory .(Meth is infamously known for that.and a significant amount of the damage inflicted upon the reward system is irreversible.they will litteraly never be happy again.)

Of course,healthy people who draw pleasure from multiple sources (achievements/reliantionships/food...) Don't put all their eggs in the same basket.

But desperate drug addicts who have nothing else but the bottle,the weed etc are very susceptible to this.

You just want to eat fast and finish the meal to calm the hunger and go back to what you really want to do : Juuling .

The brain is an idiot.You train him like a monkey he fucks you over with monkey behavior."
1056,Zoogoalkeeper,juul,ENFJ,"You will be far better off the one cig a day,
Indeed the juul is much much more potent then cigs .
Even if you only vaped half a pod a day that would still be at least 5 times more nicotine then that one cig.
Dont create new associations and habbits to feed the addiction.

Down the road you could get in an anxiety trap going back from juul to cig to cig to juul.
Wasting money and health.

I got to say though man,you might be inflicting some sort of subconscious torture to yourself always waiting for that one cig.

Lots of doctors believe it is indeed a harm reduction tool,
Lots of doctor's think its worse then cigarettes because the nicotine concentration is so high that it could become cytotoxic.
They would rather fight something they know then something where all bets are on.

Nobody can affirm any thing,the levels of nicotine available are unheard of.

Vapers who smoked for decades say the juul is way more potent then the greasiest rolled up cig ever.
They can't switch back to cigs caus they feel like air ! 

Some people who smoked 10cigs a week are now drinking 1 pod a day.And are now REALLY addicted to nicotine .
Are They better off with this crippling addiction now ?

How many people have said ""I feel better but im sooo much more addicted ""

You can argue yes you can argue no.

Its not all about lung cancer when you want to speak harm reduction.
The long term cost of an early life addiction in many cases ends up having heavier concequences then a 71years old chainsmoker dying from tobacco related disease.

A lot of kids got addicted to the juul even though they would have never smoked a cigarette had vaping never existed.

One can argue that's worse.

There is no consensus what so ever.So don't claim that shit randomly and then tell others to educate themselves.

We all need a lot more time and education before getting to a consensus."

Get over it.
You don't want to juul anymore.

No matter what.

If shit hits the fan,rolling a plant in paper will be more valuable then electronic gadgets you have to plug and maintain.

Claw damage on Khajiits is ridiculously strong on Legendary difficulty. Personally I'd like to see Enai bring Morningstar a bit closer to Imperious in some ways, such as changing the racial base stats, but still keep it minimalist.  It gets rid of some inconsistencies like you said, but adds on others in their place, although not as bad.

Just realized I'm talking to you, that's cool. Just want to say huge fan of your work, and don't take my disagreements in design the wrong way. It really just comes down to personal preference, which is why I included both of your race mods in my list.

Edit: I should clarify that Khajiit claws combined with their increased movement speed is overpowered. Not saying you should get rid of either of those but perhaps lowering them wouldn't be a bad idea.

Also I would say that you should keep the spell absorb Bretons have since probably most of the people using Morningstar approach Skyrim modding with a minimalist mindset. That being said I'm unaware of just how many complaints you got for someone else's mistake/decision.  


Edit 2 : I guess the Imperial bonus really isn't bad at all and most of the things about Morningstar are things I like. It's just feels like it so close to my idea of a perfect race mod, but just not quite there yet."

My brain feels like a safe, contained space where I can explore any immoral possibilities without having any actual karmic affect on the world. 

I have misophonia, which puts violent thoughts into my head every time someone chews loudly or snorts their nose. Of course I’m bothered by the sounds themselves and the discomfort they cause me. I HATE how angry I get about something so silly. However, I had never worried about the violent thoughts at all. I mean, they’re a knee-jerk reaction and I’d never actually follow through with any of it. 

When I first read about how intrusive thoughts afflict people with ocd, that was the first time it ever occurred to me that anybody worries about those thoughts. 

They’re just thoughts! We all have a dozen filters that they pass through before they become actions."
1148,ordinary-nobody,DnD,ESTP,"My character actually lost her memory of the cool backstory I made early on. I hadn’t thought about it but she’s become a lot blander and kinda aimless as a result.

1158,Sherbhy,cscareerquestions,INTP,"I'm also in my 3rd year of college but I'll share stuff what I've searched upon and found useful. Most of them are gonna be specific to engineering.

First decide on what you like, what in CS interests you the most, because you're gonna get a job on a specific role. You can be a fullstack developer as well but being focussed on something specific will make you learn stuff accordingly.

Watch this video to know about the types of engineers in CS:
https://youtu.be/_9ZS6q4996g

After you've decided what you like, learn about that particular thing i.e the different tools and frameworks.

I'm interested in data science so I've been learning stuff like machine learning, data science which involves python, and tools like numpy, scikit learn, Tensorflow etc.
But before learning these frameworks I learnt the basic concept behind machine learning since it involves a lot of math.
Then I started to make small implementations of what I learnt in python. I hope to make bigger stuff during my semester break.

Now since I want to be a data scientist, I don't require proficiency in stuff like java or C#. That's why it's important to chose a track you like.
While developing machine learning projects I need to deploy what I made, so for that I learnt Flask, which is a framework for back end web dev in python. This way I'm learning relevant technologies.

Java is used in a lot of places from back end web dev to android dev. If you want to work on Java, I'd suggest subscribing and following upon related subreddits and youtube channels to know what stuff people work upon in java. Do the same if you decide to work on any other track. Dedicate whatever free time you can give to this. Afterwards try finding an internship or contribute to open source projects and such to showcase your skill level and various tech you know. Cheers!"

1192,Aetheonus,heroesofthestorm,ENTJ,"Kel'thuzad originated in Warcraft 3 and became a prominent end-game WoW boss in Vanilla. Wotlk was not his first appearance.

WoW players remember him as KT, the most iconic raid boss. WC3 players remember him as KT because he was introduced first and played a bigger role in the story. Kael'thas was always just Kael."
1193,Aetheonus,Trove,ENTJ,"Trove gives you an experience somewhere between that which is offered in Minecraft, Terraria, and Cube World, bundled as one. 

There is a great deal of progression via class leveling, exploring new dungeons (which are constantly added each month) and conquering new biomes. Once you reach level 20 on a class, the adventure is not over yet, as you can gain an additional 20 levels from gear - you are able to continue to progress past the level cap by collecting gear and tailoring it to fit your specific needs and play-style, allowing you to cultivate a character that is entirely your own.

*(Note on PvE and adventuring in Trove: If you are looking for an experience similar to raiding or other end-game group content of popular MMO games, you will be disappointed. The PvE in this game is great, but it is very much open-world, similar to Guild Wars 2 in style. The focus is on collecting and refining gear, exploring, and collecting styles/materials/items at the moment. I believe the devs have alluded to working on higher level content, possible bosses and other more difficult/coordinated PvE content, but don't quote me on that.)*

Aside from the adventuring aspect, your creativity is able to thrive through Cornerstone, Club Worlds, and Styles. Styles allow you to have a customized look based on equipment you have converted into cosmetic overrides during your adventures, so that you can look unique and have an appearance that is as serious or silly as you would like for your character at any given time. 

Cornerstones, on the other-hand, allow you to make an oasis of your very own. Be it a humble home, a fantastic fortress, a lair of traps and treasures, or simply an artistic display of your own (I bet you expected an alliteration on that last one, nope!) the cornerstone is your very own outlet where you can make whatever you desire within the confines of your space (and very high up/below it as well!) Wherever you go, the Cornerstone will follow as you can summon it all throughout adventure and hub worlds on cornerstone plots to provide a place to recuperate, a haven from assault, or simply somewhere to base your next assault.

Likewise, Club Worlds allow you to - as the name implies - create a world as great or as small as you please for your club (the player organizations of this game - thinks clans, or guilds, etc.) This is slightly more advanced than cornerstones, but the possibilities are endless, and if building/creativity are your forte and desire, you will have a lot of fun visiting club worlds and designing your own.

All of this is handled on servers hosted and provided by Trion. Unlike other sandbox-style games, you do not need to seek out servers or personally create them, you simply log in and play with all of that technical work handled for you. The game is ready to play out of the box [launcher]! 

The classes also lend a great aspect of diversity and uniqueness to the game. Each class has its own strengths, weaknesses, and niches. While some may be stronger than others in some aspects, overall all classes are perfectly viable and fun to play. 

Be it an unkillable tank of a Knight, an untouchable aerial ace of a Gunslinger, a fiery and explosive Dracolyte, a teleporting glass canon Fae Trickster, a spinning flurry of blades, healing, and speed in a Candy Barbarian, a stealthy and quick Neon Ninja, a kiting-snaring-supportive Ice Sage, or a long-range sniper of destruction Shadow Hunter, you are bound to find one that suits your preferences and play style. 

Classes are added every month I believe, so there is always something new to play! 

Ultimately, this game feels very smooth, very ""complete"", and very expansive, despite still being an open beta. The devs have made it a point to involve we, the players and community, in the direction and design of the game. Classes, weapons, biomes, dungeons, and everything between, are often submitted and designed by the players themselves, so you really feel involved as the game is constantly evolving and shaped around player influences and the community as its core."

1218,ghostakir2,Enneagram9,INFP,"So if I'm reading this right, it sounds like you want him to be more motivated or to move forward? I wouldn't know the solution to your problem or his, as every situation and person is different, but hopefully I can help by sharing my own story. (Im a 9 and im pretty sure Im an sp) I personally had trouble during high school with homework, as I could never motivate myself to do it. My mom (a 1) was really bothered by this and struggled with what she could say/do to make me get things done, knowing I was stubborn and didn't like to be nagged. Heres a few points on what you could maybe do?

1. It is truly amazing what blossoms in someone when they are loved and accepted for who they are. She and other good people in my life, started loving me with my love language ( Mine being words of affirmation/quality time. Look it up if you've never heard of it, it's a life changer.) I, and my family and friends, are by no means perfect, and we do not always love each other the best. But we try, and my life is all the better.
2. I had to make some tough decisions for my life, and I made those all by myself. I don't think anyone could have told me or made me do it. But because of the people around me loving me and supporting me, I started to thrive. I also had to get to know myself in order to understand how I like to do things.
3. I was told truth, like how awesome I am, and how I deserve a good life. Eventually I started to believe it. It is crazy how we go through life, making often unconscious decisions about ourselves and the world (such as I don't deserve happiness or Im a failure).

I hope this wasn't too long, and it maybe gives you some ideas on what you can do as a supporter. Remember, you aren't responsible for someone else's choices. It's hard, but give yourself a break. Do your best to be there for them. It sounds cliche, but really the choice is up to them. Good luck!!"
