2,INTJ,"its not a common phrase, its something this particular character has invented"
3,ISFJ,"This made me so sad to read :(

My mom has BPD and I spent ten years of my young teenage/adult life trying to help her. Trying to convince her people DONT hate her. That if she was just nice and open with people that she could maintain friendships, get along with her family, and not always feel like an outcast. She never got it, she instead just lashed out at me for not supporting her mood shifts and constant new opinions on her “friends”. I was “minimizing” the situation for her in trying to help her.

This sentence you wrote really struck a cord:
“I worry I’ll have children just so there is someone else to give me love”. I believe my mom did this sadly. When I was around 14 I remember her coming into my room and crying stating “all my kids do is take take take and give nothing in return” (we were ages 14, 12, and 9 at the time). I felt guilty for being alive, but then remembered she choose to have kids; it was all very confusing. I think she was happy when we were small (all under age 10). Her emotional outbursts were minimal (unless I was oblivious) but I don’t remember. I think she was content during those years bc she finally felt like she had a clear identity: she was mom of three small children/babies who needed her and provided unconditional love to her. We chose her over others (natural parental attachment) and this made her feel special. Once we grew up and started to have our own opinions on the world, become independent....she struggled with this greatly. This is when things got really bad for me.

If it makes you feel any better, none of us have BPD. However I have severe anxiety and was depressed and suicidal for a while due to her. Your awareness of your flaws (everyone has flaws) and how you interact with others is huge. She never took responsibility for anything and said it was everyone else’s fault.


You articulating FP.....wow. My mom used to use that phrase verbatim to refer to this friend she idolized. But as with every friendship, she loved them one moment and then was skeptical/mistrusting of them the next. She can’t maintain friendships.

Thank you for giving me a glimpse of what goes on in the head of someone with BPD. It makes me so sad to think how my mom struggles internally, but never articulated. I had to break off contact with her for my own health and sanity a couple years ago...and she hasn’t spoken to me since. "

As a black, I myself am more offended at the fact dumbfucks like the show runner want to change a character just because they think I'll find it more appealing. Imagine if Black Panther was white, it's exactly like that. But just because it's white to black it isn't a big deal? GTFO"
31,INFP,"NAH. I think you have good intentions, and I understand why you want to have 1 on 1 time with your son.

Your daughter's young, however, and judging by the fact by what your wife said, it sounds like your daughter feels hurt by your actions and told your mother so. I think most children at this age would feel upset if their father did something like that, and I wouldn't be surprised if she feels or grows up to feel as if you favour her brother. You should try putting away a little more time for just her, imo; I know your family plays games together  frequently, but having 1 on 1 time on the PS4 with your daughter *as well* as with your son may make her feel less excluded, whilst still providing your son with the 1 on 1 time he needs."

Boos and likes are relative to one another.

49,INFJ,"He has done a fair amount of good in bringing newer people more in depth into typology, but I think he oversimplifies some things and over complicates others. His function descriptions are pretty narrow in focus and while they generally aren't flat out wrong, they miss the majority of what the function actually does. For example, Si being about ""receiving experience"" is only one small aspect of Si that isn't even always true and depends on the particular user in how they have learned to use their functions based on nurture.

As for other aspects of him, his discord channel is a disaster. Many people are finding that the moderator team directly under CSJ are constantly banning people for daring to disagree with aspects of his theory as though his word is the end all be all of psychology. I was personally banned for simply being apart of a different server made with the intent of allowing free speech to talk about his theory or others without worry of being banned.

Upon speaking with many people coming from different perspectives and different theories, CSJ's theory in all honesty is beginning to look like a sloppy hodgepodge of random bits of tons of other theories (very little original work) while mostly failing to acknowledge what comes from what. I have no issues with him borrowing content from other theories, but do so honestly and give some friggin credit where credit is due! It also seems that some of his actual original work is imo over exaggerated and mostly impractical. When being told by some of his personal favorite expert typists that I can't possibly have any good childhood memories because I have Si demon, I can't help but think he has taken some parts too far.

That all being said, I will admit that it was CSJ that spiked my curiosity to start digging deep into Jungian typology and without him, I may not have continued on towards studying source material and learning a lot more about it."

I actually ended up with an amazing woman, who I think I fell in love with the first moment I saw her. I met her at bible camp. We were both cabin leaders, both thought we were supposed to marry men to please God, ended up falling in love and have been together for 4.5 years. She is the perfect partner — kind, patient, and so so compassionate. I am so grateful to have found someone like her instead of settling because the bible told me to do so lol"

62,INFJ,">I believe that anyone with a ""strong"" personality is more dysfunctional than someone who seemingly comes off as unable to be typed. Ultimately, we're aiming to ""lose"" our personalities.

Would you rather be a master of none but somewhat proficient at many things or be the best at one thing? I would prefer to specialize because there are plenty of people who can do a lot of things fairly well, but there is a very big need of those who are *really* good at one thing. I would definitely say I have a strong personality and I am proud of it, because it makes me unique. If everyone was the same bland personality, then there wouldn't be a need to work together as everyone would be capable of doing the same thing. Realizing what you are good at and focusing on that gives you the ability to do that one thing far better than anyone else possibly could, which then combined with finding those who can cover your blindsides means that we can progress far more effectively as a species as all sides are covered.

I would agree that if you find yourself described completely by the ID of your type, then that probably means you are underdeveloped, which is where socionics comes in. A mature person will be harder to type as they have integrated their subconscious and unconscious sides of the mind, but these are used to amplify and cover some of the blindsides of the ego. It is also important to develop these different sides as it gives you the ability to ""interface"" with other types that you wouldn't normally be very good at communicating with, giving us even more ability to work together and increase our efficiency of problem solving.

So I guess after all that rambling, to some extent I would agree in that we need to be well rounded, but we should also acknowledge our strengths and hone it to a razor edge. Being well rounded gives us the ability to work more efficiently with others who have a different specialty, but you will *never* be as good as someone of the opposite type at their specialty, so don't pretend like you can. Be good enough at what they do to be able to appreciate their strengths, but also be humble enough to realize they are better at it and refer to them for their specialty."

91,INTP,"Depends who you ask although as a keen europhile myself I see Armenia more as a European country (and yes, I am aware that in terms of aesthetics Armenia has borrowed a lot from Middle Eastern region).  In my experience, American Armenians tend to see themselves as more Middle Eastern whereas Armenians from Armenia by and large consider themselves European ( I will try to find the source later on).

The issue is that Transcaucasian region, which is where we are, is a weird one - it does not 'obviously' fir into either the Middle East or Europe. Again, my personal experience is that people in the rest of Europe tend to consider Armenia and to a lesser extent Georgia as non-European when they see those countries on the map but after going there or talking to Armenians/Georgians they change their minds.

Someone mentioned genetic studies - here as well Armenians (just like many other borderline groups) show a great diversity - I guess many here can guess which study I will link [https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2015206](https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2015206). Plurality of Armenians have R1b haplogroup, although J2 and  haplogroup G  are also highly common. In terms of phenotype Armenians are also highly diverse - my mother is usually confused with North Eastern European, with my dad most people think he is a Jew from Israel while my brother is usually considered French (and we all come from Armenia). This is coming from just one family but there are many people who could easily be confused with Indians or Western Europeans."

There's not a lot here to determine tertiary Fe vs. inferior Fi. Slightly more evidence of low-stack Fe than low-stack Fi, which fits. The first two functions are more important, especially at 19 when lower functions are weaker."

Like being high and eating are required to go together.

Becoming aware of this pattern has helped me a lot. I had to stop getting stoned before going out to eat because it was reinforcing the idea that weed enhances the experience of food.

142,INTJ,"it doesnt have to mbe morally justified, nor is it based in her contribution or any conception of ""deserving""

a marriage is like a legal partnership in the eyes of the law.  when you are married you each own 100% of the marital assets.   when you divorce you are each apportioned 50/50 in a community property state or some other portion in an equitable distribution state.  there is no moral issue here.  this is about legal joint ownership of all marital assets by the MARRIAGE.  the marriage is a legla union, a ""corporate person"" economically.

marriage is not employment.  she was not the marriage's employee, she didnt own the marital assets because of her ""contribution"" to the marriage but because of the legal state of marriage and nothing else.  again, DURING the marriage she had 100% ownership of all the marital assets, and so did he.  by divorcing SHE LOSES HALF OF HER ASSETS TOO, she doesnt GAIN half of HIS assets

we can argue over whether it should be this way, and since only nine states are pure 50/50 community property states obviosuly other arrangements are possible

the moralizing of the arrangement is baseless and nuts.

152,INTJ,"Good question!

The term actually has different meanings in different places.

In Israel, most believers would call themselves Messianic rather than Christian, as the term is much less loaded with potential negative connotation. This is quite a fair thing to do, esp. as 'Christ' comes from the Greek translation of the word Messiah.

In America there is a strong Messianic movement which is essentially a group of people moving back to the Jewish roots of the faith.

The range here is quite significant. Some people enjoy the odd Jewish feast for fun, and like to learn more about the Old Testament, etc.

On the other hand, you can get people doing things like: calling themselves Jews when they aren't biologically, moving back into legalism, or having a significant superiority complex. There can sometimes be a very painful culture of people being almost bizarrely attached to the minutia of Jewish tradition, even more so than Messianic believers in Israel.

Outside of the States this range exists as well, although there's probably a lower concentration of what you might call 'hard-core' Messianic culture.

Having had a little bit to do with different people in these ranges, I think there's a lot to gain from the understandings of people in the Messianic movement, but also a fair bit of peril in sacrificing the Centrality of Christ on the altar of Jewishness."

154,ENFP,"Sure. It is very easy to make. You need cream horn or cannolli mold or you can make DIY version yourself. Cut puff pastry into stripes of 2 cm wide, spread with the rolling pin until they become twice in length. Wrap them around the molds (if your mold is large wrap two stripes) and let them bake for around 15 mins in 180-200 centigrade oven. After they cooled down a bit you can separate the molds.
For the filling I just used simple whipping cream with powdered sugar and vanilla. You can add strawberry pieces to the cream which becomes amazing or use creme pattisiere instead which I like more. And in the end spread sugar powder on top.let then stay in the fridge for 3-4 hours before serving."
155,INFJ,"Intuition to me is a method of approaching information. It involves a hands off observational approach that analyzes the info, comparing and tying together bits of the info until it forms a big picture grasp of what is happening. It is very fast about building a framework to then expand upon or strengthen when given new information.

Sensors in contrast are more likely to take little bits of information and slowly piece them together to form the whole theory, and so are not as quick at times to observe the big picture understanding, but are more methodical in approach.

I guess to make a metaphor for it, sensors prefer building up the house one brick at a time, starting from the ground and methodically working up. Intuitives ignore the bricks at first and build a scaffold or frame that outlines the house before filling it in as the bricks come, often in no particular order."

The shy awkward dork character trope is far less used because if done wrong it makes the MC bland and boring and frustrating, all of which describes the new MC.

You should keep that in mind.

But if it emotionally affects you, talk to her.but i would refrain on insisting that it is wrong for her to post the pictures. You  can only ask her to stop doing that for your emotional wellbeing and for the relationship with you.

If it furthermore stays a conflict it would be good to reevaluate if you two and your morals are compatible and talk with  her  about it and if there is no compromising for the two of you it would be time to part."

240,ESTP,"The other two Stooges in my three-piece ensemble are an ENTP 7w6 (?) and an ESFP 3w2. Nowadays, we only really hang out at once during Halloween, since we don’t really live close together, but Halloween is nuts and shows off the group dynamic pretty well.

I remember we were trick-or-treating at this rich place with a lot of Indian people, and I asked this one lady, “Do you celebrate Halloween in India?” My 7w6 friend gave me a weird look. Next house had an Indian person, too, and I asked the same question, and he got even more nervous, which kept getting funnier and funnier. The next house had a white person answering the door.

“Do they celebrate Halloween in India?” My 7w6 friend just walked away without a word and we both started bursting out laughing. I did the same thing at 14 consecutive houses and he eventually just put up with it with the most “Fucking kill me” face, although he’d leave if it was an actual Indian person at the door. I asked him why he was so nervous, given that most of these people were actually Indian, and he just yelled “Exactly! That’s exactly why!”

As for my 3w2 friend, he’s the most popular one out of the three of us. Me and my 7w6 the only one of the guys that doesn’t seem to suck up to him, which I’ve always found funny, since it’s not like he’s very threatening? Aside from physically being the weakest of of us, he’s also the most tolerant when it comes to being made fun of. Anyway, he tends to be “airheaded charismatic,” where his attention span wanders while someone’s talking, and comedy ensures when he gets called out. We were at this one middle-aged woman’s house, and she starts talking to my 3w2 friend as she’s giving out candy.

W: “So, what’s your name?”

3w2: “Hm? Oh, hi.”

W: “I said ‘What’s your name?’”

3w2: “Oh, okay. My name is [name].”

W: “Oh, okay.”

3w2: “No, you’re good.”

W: “What?”

My 7w6 friend started cracking up at the fact that they were having two different conversations, although I wasn’t paying attention myself. It’s funny in hindsight, but I was confused as hell when my best friend was trying to explain it to both of us when she closed the door.

As for me, I’d say I’m the loudest of my friend group, mainly because I’m also the most physically hyperactive. I also enjoy pranking the others the most, like when me and my 7w6 friend pretended to be my 3w2 friend’s girlfriend over text when he got a new phone. It was great.

As for Halloween, aside from being an enabler to the rest of the guys, I mainly remember attaching a Reese’s Cup to a Beyblade spinner and having it explode, although that’s probably the tamest thing I did all night."

I’m not telling him because we aren’t currently talking; he’s upset with me, and now I get to be stonewalled for days. Which actually proves my point that started this argument to begin with — not just a bogus fight brought on by cold feet. (Not being able to tell him things without fear of being stonewalled, and it results in me just walking around on eggshells all the time.) We are supposed to move in together in a week, and I brought once again brought this up as a concern. I don’t know how I’m going to deal with being stonewalled in my own home, blatantly to my face.

I also appreciate friends that reach out to me often because I’m not the best at communicating first or initiating things. It’s nice when people treat me like I’m an important part of their life because a lot of times I can feel like I’m invisible or forgettable to other people because I don’t speak up very much in larger groups. My love language is acts of service and quality time is a close 2nd. I make friends pretty slowly because I rarely ever initiate, but if someone makes a point to invite me to hang out with them one-on-one or in a small group, and is  genuinely interested in what I have to say, then I feel loved and accepted."

365/48 = 7.604.....

ANS \* 138.18 = $1050.74 to feed the world for a whole year

Amount raised by Sport Relief 2018 =  **£38,195,278**

£38,195,278 =  $48,538,597.48

$48,538,597.48 / $1050.74 =  46194.679 years

311,ISFP,"I'll add some things that might be hard to respond to (as a /F sometimes feeling overwhelmed with msgs):

* (legit happened a couple of times) ""I didn't read your whole post but I think we'd be great friends"" :D

* (optional) mentioning interests but not being specific (naturally you get responses from ppl who have same interests as you, and you may get many msgs that seem looking almost identical for this reason - meaning, who's gonna be the one getting a response? The one bringing up specific topics to attention. - But yeah it's not a rule, sometimes I just prefer answering to a brief msg because it doesn't let me overthink things, you kinda just let the things play out.)

* people who msg might not have mutual goal for friendship or the goal might be unclear (saying ""you're just bored"" when the post is asking for a close friend, time schedule/demands might not match, ...)

* (potentially negative) way too long msgs (think past half the page up to entire screen you view on your 24"" FHD monitor)

* **Also for what helps;** big one - giving a rough draft of what are you up to / going through in the life right now (both positive or negative) usually gives me a fine opportunity to relate or ""see"" the person behind the text

Also honestly I don't know about the deal with bad msgs, I feel like large majority of what I ever get on these subreddits are pretty fine responses (open, personal, friendly)."

There is no universal consensus amongst the scientific community.it is torn apart.
Some countries have come to a concensus,like the UK,but they don't represent the whole scientific world.

Lots of doctors believe it is indeed a harm reduction tool,
Lots of doctor's think its worse then cigarettes because the nicotine concentration is so high that it could become cytotoxic.
They would rather fight something they know then something where all bets are on.

Nobody can affirm any thing,the levels of nicotine available are unheard of.

Vapers who smoked for decades say the juul is way more potent then the greasiest rolled up cig ever.
They can't switch back to cigs caus they feel like air !

Some people who smoked 10cigs a week are now drinking 1 pod a day.And are now REALLY addicted to nicotine .
Are They better off with this crippling addiction now ?

How many people have said ""I feel better but im sooo much more addicted ""

You can argue yes you can argue no.

Its not all about lung cancer when you want to speak harm reduction.
The long term cost of an early life addiction in many cases ends up having heavier concequences then a 71years old chainsmoker dying from tobacco related disease.

A lot of kids got addicted to the juul even though they would have never smoked a cigarette had vaping never existed.

One can argue that's worse.

There is no consensus what so ever.So don't claim that shit randomly and then tell others to educate themselves.

We all need a lot more time and education before getting to a consensus."

I legit can't think of a single time that my dad has apologized for anything, regardless of who the recipient should have been. What's worse is my brother (16), is picking up on this, and me and my mom are working on trying to get him to understand that accepting responsibility for your actions and apologizing when needed is important and it's not something you can ignore. I can't do much now since I go to school 4 hours from home (I do come back for breaks). It is kinda frustrating to see him take on after one of my dad's worst aspects, and because of my dad, I feel like I'm the opposite and apologize too much, but I am working on not being so contrite."

348,ISFP,"I am going to pick on some things that might or might not be a part of the issue

* You rely _entirely_ on someone's else's opinion (and on top of it, one person only) instead of making your own (that's not a problem in itself if you might be blind to certain facts)

* You have a negative attitude: ""I'm not the greatest looking guy he ever met"" = you translate it into ""told me I look ugly"", not being the prettiest person doesn't have to do with being really ugly

* Has he objectively stated what's the problem? Everyone has good and bad parts (looks) and sometimes all it takes is to lift up the positives to hide/balance the negatives.

* Don't base your value (or whatever you want to call it) purely based off your looks. They matter more in certain fields (modeling, ...) and less in others (jobs to do with other skills and to real friends).

I believe you feel so down about being told this because you maybe based your whole identity around your looks? (I could be wrong though.) It's important to maintain development in many various life areas that grant you confidence in yourself so when you don't experience ""heights"" in one, you won't go the depressive route because you still get to appreciate yourself for many other things - think of them as having crutches to hold onto."

How long do I rub it in?” and I’m just wondering why the eff it’s so confusing for him. To me, it’s OBVIOUS; I’ve been working on my skincare since I was 12. He had bad acne his entire teen years and no one told him facewash made a difference, let alone everything else available.

For some reason, male hygiene is so low on the list in society. Yeah, my husband is dense, but I feel like it still should have been taught to him. Totally agree!! I hope male skincare becomes normalized!"

372,ISFP,"I'm 6'3 195lbs and I wear a medium for most pants/shorts, especially athletic wear because I don't want my pants to fall down at the gym. My waist is like 32-33"" so wearing a large would be too big, but I have a pretty lean build and most of my weight is in my chest, back, and legs. if you have more of an average build then it'd make sense to go L, but these models are probably all like 170-190lbs and very lean.

also athletic pants usually have a fixed inseam across all sizes, so sizing up doesn't make them longer. or it's only an inch or two difference and I'd rather have pants that stay on at the gym than have pants that are long enough but also fall down."

379,ESTP,"I think it more has to do with needs, expectations and willingness to accept change.

Positive change is very easy to accept. If I won the lottery, awesome I’m cool with that. Negative change is harder to accept as it threatens our needs and our expectations.

I think there is a evolutionary tendency for people to be comfortable with a way of life that keeps them alive. We live in a world where our needs to live are easily met. However, any threat to that way of life, misfires that hormonal response to a degree where we feel our world in crumbling down and we need to adapt in order to survive. Even if it would be very easy for us to survive.

The truth is, the world is a unforgiving place. A lot of people aren’t willing to accept that. The world wasn’t made to enjoy, but made to survive and overcome. Negative experiences only bring you closer to that realization. As negative things are only negative if you are unprepared or unable to accept them.

If you see the world as a fantasy land you’ll live your life forever disappointed, but if you see the world and its potential to be cruel you can prepare and adapt, and that is the only way you can be truly grateful for the positive things that enter your life.

383,ESTP,There should be a story megathread
384,ESTP,"What if he was replying to a comment that was replying to a post? When you press on the post yourself it's probably better formatted anyway. Also, OP mostly replies to type me posts, and he will have to copy and paste some large chunks and it's tougher for you to scroll down **and** find what actually was commented by OP which will be worse if he doesn't bold some sentences. OP may also think that his history presents his authentic self instead of those questions because he may not be self-aware.

Looking through his comment section is pretty much the same as reading through a chunk of answers to the megathread questions. I think that OP is actually making it easier for you since his thought process and preferences are easily shown through what he does in his history rather than some carefully chosen answers that may or may not show biasedness.

>MAKE you do the whole thing.

If someone's type me post provides less information than OP's history, it's even worse than what you suggested. Over here it's quality over quantity.

I get what you mean, and I'm just trying to say that sometimes the history says much more about a person than their selected information about themselves. Take type me threads as interviews and their history as their informal self. Which do you think portray themselves better? "
385,ENFJ,"With that pc, I think Torchlight 1&2 are your best options right now. The developers actually separated from Blizzard's D2 team, so the gameplay is nearly the same, but with more creativeness in it. You should really try it out. The best ARPG for low-end imho.

Other games from the same genre for low-end includes:
- Titan Quest (get both Immortal Throne + Ragnarok to be good, a bit pricey for what it offers imo)
- Dungeon Siege 2 (runs terribly on win 8 + 10, need lots of tweak to work properly on those 2)
- Fate (Undiscovered Realms, Traitor Souls are must have, Cursed King is good but optional)"

400,ISFP,"Could be, I think it's often the flying Mercy (or other support) I try to bubble during those critical ults (which don't provide for being at a good angle sadly as lots of stuff is already happening)"
401,ISTJ,"Yelled at the morning of my Cal BC AP exam the moment I got out of bed over not communicating or some other bullshit I was not in the mood for (I had issues with this in highschool, have improved on it, but tbh, the parent yelling at me was shit with communication too). I don't even remember if it was for the test or some other crap (I write all of my test dates on the family calendar in the kitchen, everyone in the house passes it and reads it at least once in a day so no one can claim they didn't see it on there), and I went to school feeling miserable af. My friends and my Cal BC teacher were concerned and I think I eventually told them what happened but yeah. One of my worst mornings growing up. Parent kept telling me I was worthless, useless, etc., and I told myself ""Thank god I'm moving 4 hours away for college b/c I can't take this shit anymore."""
402,ESTJ,"I like to think, ""I'm okay. Everything I feared would happen happened, and guess what? I'm still here in a first world country with great health and a loving family (or insert other blessings)."" It's similar, but we need to realize that sometimes our mind takes fear and anxiety out of proportion to our detriment."
403,ESFJ,So what you're saying is I can expect a down vote from your husband?
404,ISFP,"In muslim countries they hatw christians because they are rich because they own all of the liquor stores. And basically have an ethnic monopoly on the business sort of.

Same thing for the ""jewish bankers""
Christians and muslims were to stupid to lend money because of Usery. So it was outsourced to the jews and so naturally they had an ethnic monopoly on that bussiness."
405,ESTJ,You mean people of all races know how to through down? shocker
406,ISFJ,Exactly. You can be honest and direct without being a fucking dickhead.
407,ISFJ,I swear you must be high or something
408,ESFJ,Run and don’t look back. You deserve better.
409,ISTJ,Back when the Reds and Blues weren't as serious as they are now. Those were the days.
410,ISFJ,just a little bit caught in the middle
411,ESTJ,"Has no one considered that Connor might be one of the people who die? Sad thought to think any of them could die, but given Connor's.. mental state, or at least former mental state, maybe he might not be stable enough to deal with all this anymore and he might just pull his own plug. It seems unrealistic, but in this show, who's to say it couldn't happen?

But if Connor doesn't die, then I'm about 99.9% sure that Annalise is going to die in some way, shape, or form."
412,ESFP,"Freddie apparently used a lot of made up words in scrabble.

He also used a lot of made up words in his songs. "
413,ISFJ,We used to use pumpkins instead of player heads
414,ESTJ,Best response to a nice guy thus far.
415,ISTJ,"As a girl, I personally just don't think like this. There probably are plenty of others who do though. You know, the egotistical type "
416,ESFJ,"How about Tiger & Bunny? It's a great action anime, no fanservice and you can even use it to discuss social issues (completely optional of course. XD) best part is that the male protagonist is a father who is trying to engage more with his daughter. I think it's a great show for the family."
417,ISFP,Perfectly balanced. As all things should be
418,ISTJ,"It really was beautiful, wasn't it?"
419,ISFP,"I have some in slim L Long and I wish I had gotten slim XL(or standard L) instead, so I would say maybe size up to slim L or standard fit M. For reference I'm around 6'3 195lbs with more of an athletic build, chest is around 43"""
420,ESTJ,"True. I agree. So many friends ghosted me as soon as I started gaining weight. Yet, the ones who stayed I came to appreciate a lot more and realise how good of a friend they are.

EDIT: Sorry!! I meant gaining weight, not losing weight."
421,ESTJ,I bet 90% of the people who just say they're boring have something really cool about them and they just haven't realised.
422,ESFJ,I can only read 1 book at a time. I feel that a story should be wrapped up before i move on to the next one.
423,ESTJ,"That's not normal in the USA, not for standard ADHD medication. Psychiatrists ask about what else you're on, because some meds interact with others. If they're demanding that you take a different medication outside their specialty, that's a red flag. Mine wanted to know what I was taking, but not taking anything else wasn't a problem.

And she should have asked about other symptoms in session. If you can pick a different doctor, consider doing that."
424,ESTJ,"her boobs are so squashed  i bet she had trouble breathing
im a woman so i know"
425,ESFJ,Somehow I read this in Sean Connery’s voice
426,ISTJ,"No but I've been looking for some, I also want some consolation"
427,ESFP,He should be selling this shit smh
428,ESFJ,"By the way, hi everyone! I'm a new face on Reddit, made an account 1 year 5 months ago but only decided to get active in a bunch of subs from this week onwards. I used to be active on forums, back when forums were a thing, so i really missed the community feel. Everyone seems to be really nice so far, so i'm hoping to get to know you all better. Yoroshiku~.

Also, happy Lunar New Year to the Chinese folks who celebrate it. \o/ it's on tuesday."
429,ESFJ,Wait. Why aren't you zooming with me?
430,ESTJ,"Lol when I first read your comment I thought you guys travelled at the same time like ""hey where are you"" ""france, you?"" ""canada"" ""fuck"""
431,ISFP,"Tbh after being Gold for two seasons I started noticing that I actually DO have an impact on the game outcome. After I started recording my games it's much more clear how I can ""carry"" by making less mistakes regardless of champ. And those mistakes are really small and still make a great impact.

Some of the winnable games I technically throw with one small mistake and then there are games you indeed have no influence on - people who throw/leave 'cause you lose point A or a couple of disorganized people not playing as a team at once. And then there are games you get carried even though you play terribly.

This all leads to ups and downs in your SR and eventually you come back to your initial rank again."
432,ISFP,That's some serious customer service
433,ESFP,Post nut clarity be like limitless and soul ties be like orochimaru tryna find a body
434,ESTJ,"I'm also surprised by men who do this. What do they think, that you're gonna be like ""YEA WHAT A PIG AMIRITE LUL"""
435,ESFP,"Not to mention the dream/nightmare in the middle

EDIT: Forgot a word"
436,ESTJ,I wish more men would learn this
437,ESTJ,"I believe the word you are looking for is 'trivialized' (To make [something] seem less important, significant, or complex than it truly is), but I understand what you're trying to say."
438,ESFJ,He picked the wrong day to fly in white pants
439,ESTJ,"Getting someone deported is not a felony or crime. It does make you a heartless creature, but it doesn't make you a criminal. At least, I don't think it is."
440,ESFP,"From Astros postgame:

""Hosmer ran a good 35 yards to get that ball...problem was he only needed to run 33."""

442,ESFJ,Well the traction comes from the very same people who watch seasonal anime.
443,ESTJ,Would you like to share my 50 pound Snorlax bean bag plush?
444,ESFP,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately and what it means to buy ""investment pieces"".

I think even classic pieces are going to change as trends do. For example, jeans and a t-shirt will always be classic. But that description is pretty generic. If you pick out even the most basic jeans and t-shirt outfit today, chances are it'll look dated in 10 years. Subtle things like the cut of jeans and the cut of the t-shirt are still going to eventually start looking dated (and then eventually come back again). Think bootcut jeans, skinny jeans, mom jeans, bell bottoms, kick flares, any type of jeans--they're all tied to a specific time and set of trends. T-shirts probably less so, but subtle changes will make a difference.

Hell, even colors and fabrics in and of themselves can be tied to a specific set of trends in time, before they've even been turned into a garment.

This isn't to say that there aren't classics items. I would say pencil skirts, blazers, leather jackets, basic heels and flats are all classic. But there's still a lot of room for interpretation within those pieces. What color/texture/fabric/print? Details on a blazer or hardware color on a leather jacket? Round or pointed toe on shoes?

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that trends vary so wildly that it's almost impossible to find something that's truly classic. Things that are are likely to be plain black with no detail or uniqueness in cut whatsoever. There is a place for clothes that are so neutrally basic; IMO, those are the pieces you should treat as ""investments"" because they're not going to go out of style, because they don't really *have* a style.

Now, I say this as somebody who does a lot of thrift shopping. I have a lot of pieces that are straight out of the 80s or 90s and they look like it. It might be trendy now, it might not be. I love that look. It's just not classic because it looks like x decade's trends.

Again, this is something that I think carefully about when I'm considering an 'investment piece'. We are all looking at clothes through the lens of current trends, whether we like it or not, whether we think we're influenced by trends or not. Even the people who are designing our clothing are influenced by (or creating) our current trends when they design what they think are classic pieces. What might look classic right now might not in x year's time. "
445,ESFP,"I think they read very ""sorority girl in the South"". If that's your thing, go for it I guess. I don't think they're tacky in the way that the tramp stamp/whale tail thing of the 2000s is tacky, but I do agree with the other comments here that they're kinda useless and not particularly stylish IMO. "
446,ESFP,"As a Californian, I can verify that water is cold as fuck"
447,ESFJ,"You're a good man, Charlie Brown."
448,ESFJ,"I’ll be planning return trips, I just wanted to get my bearings this time around and when I feel more comfortable/return with friends I might venture out a bit further. I just didn’t want to get lost in there suburbs by myself/with a complete stranger. I might do though if I run out of food to inhale in the city. "
449,ESFP,"The ""don't be dirty"" marketing makes me really sad. I've seen a lot of advertising lately (geared toward pre-teens and teens, it seems like) that seems to suggest that washing your face and getting ""clean"" will rid you of all skin woes. Why perpetuate the idea that acne is caused by ""dirt"" when really, it's mostly hormones and genetics? Marketing like this makes people with acne feel like shit about themselves and encourages clear-skinned people to see acne sufferers as dirty people who don't wash their face. I wish these companies would market their products in a way that encourages a good, effective routine for acne sufferers instead of pushing the idea that drying the fuck out of your face will magically cure your skin woes. "
450,ESFP,":( that was kinda sad, 10 seconds isn't that much to ask for"
451,ESFP,Lol I feel like I would remember if the Yankees offered me a contract for anything.

454,ESFP,"Freddie said on his deathbed of his legacy, ""you can do whatever you want with my music, but don't make me boring""—I bet he'd be thrilled to know, 27 years later, he's the opposite of boring and still so dearly loved and sorely missed. I am so thankful to get to live in a world that has been touched by Freddie and his music. ❤"
455,ESFP,"It's all good - everything will be right in the world.

Glad they got it out of their system, probably the most exciting thing that's happened for the franchise in a while."
456,ESFP,"This is MBTI abuse reeeeeee

I personally love this typology system among others, but things like this make it look bad "
457,ESFJ,"As someone who wants to apologise for their behaviour/share of mistakes in a past relationship. Is that really welcome?

I’ve always thought that wanting to open the lines of communication to apologise as is selfish because it only brings closure to person who is sorry and might cause the other person to reopen old wounds and suffer again."
458,ESFP,Both siblings with the same sexual boundary issues screams sexual abuse to me.
459,ESFJ,"But be sure that you’ve made progress and have truly grown from the experience. Because me too, except I was the girl who would’ve given anything. "
460,ESFP,"Yeah, the doc said something like 80-90% of cat bites wind up getting infected because of the type of bacteria in their mouths that humans aren't able to fight off. Either way, bites/puncture wounds are no joke, they're hard to keep clean and it's best to just see a damn doctor lol"
461,ESFJ,Barawa. His idiocy is cute in the stories but if i had a detective like that IRL handling my case i'd be downright frustrated.

464,ESFP,">(although I always love good coping-with-depression tips).

Hi friend! I have depression too. I feel a lot better when I'm keeping myself busy, seeing friends/family, getting out of the house in some way or another. Not sure if this is the case for other people with depression, but I'm a mega extrovert and being around people really helps. The hard part is actually getting out of bed and getting the motivation to do something.

My therapist said something to me the other day that really stuck with me and I figured I'd share it with you too. I told her I didn't do something because I didn't feel like it. She told me that ""feelings shouldn't dictate our actions."" Feelings can shape how we approach problems or challenges, but ""I don't feel like it"" isn't a good enough reason to not do something.

It's helped me a lot because when I've made plans to see family or something and I'm debating canceling but the only reason for doing so is that I don't feel like it, that's not good enough. If I end up doing whatever I needed to do anyway I always feel a lot better afterward. Again, YMMV but that was a good little nugget of wisdom I wanted to share. Take care! :)"
465,ESFJ,Was this originally posted on Tumblr?
466,ESFP,"Yep.
 Win by .3%? Total win!
Lose by 10? Total win!

Or when they tell me about a Netflix show I don't know about and won't ever watch:

474,ESFP,"I'll start! I'd say about 80% of my wardrobe these days is thrifted and I've figured out some useful tips and tricks that make the hunt easier and more rewarding:

-Look through absolutely everything. Plan on spending a good couple hours in the store. You might be missing a great find by skimming through the racks.

-Shop all sizes/sections; too-big items can have a cool slouchy fit and often items are stuck in the wrong size section anyway. Some of my best finds are from the men's section. Lots petite women find clothes in the kid's section, too.

-Going off that, try *everything* on if possible, especially if the store won't take returns

-If you're not savvy with a needle and thread and won't bother taking items to a tailor, don't buy anything that doesn't fit in a way you like. If you are, don't buy anything that will require such an extensive fix that you'll never get around to it.

-On the other hand, some simple alterations can take an item from dated to really modern and cool. I buy a lot of oversized jackets/blazers in cool 80s prints and rip the shoulder pads out to give them a more modern silhouette.

-Learn to spot quality. If it's pilled or worn looking, pass on it. Study up on what makes a quality garment, like the cut, material, and stitching. Learn which brands are usually indicative of good quality and which aren't, and don't be afraid to google a brand you don't know. Brands aren't everything but definitely are a good starting point. I'll always pass on anything F21/H&M in the thrift store, but I'll take a second glance at something from Ann Taylor or Eileen Fisher.

-In a similar vein, learn how good quality material (silk, cashmere, pima cotton) feels to the touch so that you can run your hand along the racks and single out the good stuff.

-Look at care instructions. You'll want to wash it right away before wearing it. If it's dry clean only, will you bother to take it to the dry cleaner? If not, does it look like it'll hold up to a gentle hand wash? If not, don't buy something you won't even get around to washing. "
475,ESFJ,"Oh, that's good, I'm a good bunny. ::Hops over fence::"
476,ESFJ,"Can't deny that when i was watching the show, i was mentally egging him on too because at the time, literally NOTHING interesting had been going on for the past... 6 episodes? I forgot how many."
477,ESFJ,Speak to them in fluent Japanese. That is the only way to convince them (that you're too far gone).
478,ESFJ,"Because 7 can be the average of 10 and 4, so the ones who rated them as 10 will be arguing heatedly with the ones who rated them as 4?

I don't use MAL but i'm guessing that's how scoring systems work."
