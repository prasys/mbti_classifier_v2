# mbti_classifier

This is the repository for my project to classify text using a Naive Bayes model. Data is mined from Reddit's
r/mbti comments and their respective Myers Briggs Type.

## Usage

```bash
python3 dataset.py
```
# to create dataset

```bash
python3 sorter.py
```
# to balance the dataset (cut off excess data for each type)

```bash
python3 classify.py
```
# change the text in classify.py to classify yourself
